After servitors isolated the room within a grounded mesh, he cast off the disguise and transmitter, identified himself as Jules Verne Durand of <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/antarct>Laterre</a> (the world some call Antarct), and stated that the figure presented as his servitor—Orhan—was in fact a minder from another world.<p>While departing Tredegarh amid a controlled dispersal, he spent long stretches on headsets relaying information over the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/reticulum>Reticulum</a>; when the link was cut in transit he showed obvious relief and fatigue. Observers note his strong Orth despite having studied it only briefly by Laterran standards.<h2>Roles and Information Shared</h2><ul><li>Infiltration and mission: He explains that he was inserted under Matarrhite cover as part of an intelligence probe to assess whether tales of Incanters (and related powers) had any grounding. He reports that the Matarrhite concent was covertly seized, with its people kept unharmed but silenced, to facilitate the ruse.<li>Factions among the visitors: He describes a bloc alliance—called the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a> by its members—comprising peoples of Urnud and Tro, in tension with Fthos, and says Laterre itself is divided between sympathies. He portrays the Pedestal leadership as fearful of Arbre’s capabilities and considering extreme measures. These are his statements, offered under pressure and time constraints. An opposition movement aboard the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a> is referred to as the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a>.<li>Travel account: Briefly outlines a tradition of inter‑cosmic voyages aboard a craft refitted across “Advents,” centering on a ship known as the Daban Urnud. He presents this as context rather than theorem, noting he is a linguist, not a theor.<li>Communications debrief: During evacuation travel he is “pumped” for details via the Reticulum, at times sketching diagrams; connectivity is curtailed while moving and is expected to resume through wired links when stationary.<li>Surveillance capabilities: He underscores that the Urnudans couple excellent telescopes to syndevs to sift imagery and detect decoys, reinforcing cautions not to rely on simple balloon tricks.<li>Ship structure and modeling: Later, a compact description he disseminates over the Reticulum lets the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/antiswarm>Antiswarm</a> assemble a faithful three‑dimensional model of the visitors’ ship. He describes the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/orbstack>Orbstack</a> as a column of sixteen half‑water‑filled spheres providing pseudogravity by rotation around a central “chimney” packed with trusswork, power, propulsion magazines, corridors, and optics; the Orbstack is suspended within a rubble shield by giant shock pistons whose outer vertices host command spaces, access tunnels, instruments, and an optical observatory.<li>Interior features and protocols: When questioned, he supplies practical details: how doors and latches operate, broad cues for distinguishing among Urnudans, Troäns, Laterrans, and Fthosians, and routine safety measures. He notes the Geometers’ particular dread of fire in weightless areas and says lockers with respirators, fireproof suits, and extinguishers are spaced at short intervals. While on the hull he advised entering via the Core by first using an observatory vertex; he explained that the main telescope dome is itself a large airlock and that instruments are operated remotely over the Reticulum. At the open dome he made contact in Fthosian with an on‑duty astronomer through the hatch window.<li>Stance near the World Burner: As the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/valers>Valers</a> committed to a boarding run toward the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/world-burner>World Burner</a>, he voiced torn loyalties between shipboard factions yet stated unambiguous support for preventing the device’s use, and cautioned against introducing “Everything Killers” into the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>.<li>Standing and sympathies aboard ship: According to senior shipboard accounts, he is recognized as the foremost authority on <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/orth>Orth</a> and on the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/avout>avout</a> among the visitors, and is quietly sympathetic to the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a>.<li>Ecba signal and symbolic exchange: Interpreting <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fraa-orolo>Fraa Orolo</a>’s analemma signal as pointing to <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/ecba>Ecba</a>, he proposed that it would have strong symbolic value to deliver the collected blood samples there as an exchange of “blood for blood.”<li>Probe volunteer and reassignment: He volunteered to accompany the capsule to Ecba but was reassigned to an operation at the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/matarrhites>Matarrhites</a> concent; <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/lise>Lise</a> went in his stead—drawing on Orth she had learned from him—and was shot while boarding the probe.</ul><h2>Traits and Practical Constraints</h2><ul><li>Linguist and interpreter: Chosen for Orth proficiency; earlier, his speech and dining customs led observers to treat “Zh’vaern” as a Matarrhite. During flight he alternates between speaking and drawing, but tires as the debrief extends.<li>Medical interpreting: On board the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>, he serves as interpreter between Arbran and Laterran medical staff during recovery care for the Arbran contingent.<li>Diet incompatibility: Arbran enzymes cannot digest his provisions, and he cannot metabolize local food. Remaining Laterran victuals were gathered for him; he sometimes eats local bread for fullness but relies for nutrition on Laterran supplies. He expects compatible food to be available aboard the Daban Urnud.<li>Diet aboard ship: Once on the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>, he has access to Laterre‑compatible food and eats readily.<li>Technical grasp: When introduced to suit‑integrated upper stages intended for independent ascent and maneuver, he immediately recognizes the design concept and operating logic, aiding discussions about how the gear will be used in orbit.<li>Launch tolerance: During the ascent he was more affected than most, becoming disoriented and incoherent, but recovered with rest and care.<li>Atmosphere acclimatization: After time on <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/arbre>Arbre</a>, he can tolerate its air without assistance; shipboard explanations attribute this to acclimatization over a week or two.<li>Phrases and mannerisms: Uses “Say zhoost” as a brief expression of approval.<li>Core‑temperature transponder: He does not retain the swallowed core‑temperature transponder (he reports vomiting it), which led to misleading suit readings and necessitated attention from <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/suur-vay>Suur Vay</a>. Within the cell, some avout voice theories about hidden payloads associated with such devices; these are presented as in‑group speculation, not established fact. <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fraa-jad>Fraa Jad</a> is similarly noted as not carrying one.</ul><h2>Relationships and Affiliations</h2><ul><li>Lise: He identifies the deceased woman recovered at <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/orithena>Orithena</a> as his wife, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/lise>Lise</a>. He states they had no children and grieves her loss.<li>Orhan: Publicly revealed as his minder from Urnud (not a Matarrhite servitor). A concealed wireless transmitter was taken off him after the room was shielded.<li>Convox leadership and doyns: Speaks directly with senior avout and Sæcular guests at messal to deliver warnings and context about the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/geometers>Geometers</a> and their internal politics.<li>Traveling companions: After Tredegarh he departs with a mixed cell under military escort and trains alongside avout including <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fraa-erasmas>Erasmas</a>, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fraa-jesry>Fraa Jesry</a>, and <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/fraa-lio>Lio</a>. He also confides in <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/sammann>Sammann</a> and works with him on communications.<li>Suur Vay: Provided calm field care in orbit, tending both him and Fraa Jad until they stabilized.</ul><h2>Current Status</h2><p>After helping to gain entry via the observatory dome, he remains aboard the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>. As Arbrans receive medical care in shipboard facilities, he assists as an interpreter for treatment and debriefing, and is in good health.</div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>A linguist from Laterre who infiltrated the Tredegarh Convox disguised as “Fraa Zh’vaern.” Recognized among the visitors for Orth and avout expertise, he later helps guide entry via an observatory airlock on the Daban Urnud and confers with an on‑duty Fthosian astronomer.</div></div><div class=mb-3 data-pagefind-ignore><strong>First seen:</strong><br><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/45>Part 10: Messal - Chapter 45: Syntactic Faculties</a></div><div class=mb-3 data-pagefind-ignore><strong>Most recently seen:</strong><br><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51>Part 12: Requiem - Chapter 51</a></div><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Known as:</strong><br><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Fraa Zh’vaern</span><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Jules</span><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Jules Verne Durand</span></div><hr class=mb-3><div data-pagefind-ignore><a class=text-decoration-none href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/51/jules-verne-durand/history/> View history </a></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="container text-center"><hr><small>📚</small></footer><script src=https://avoutarchive.com/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=https://avoutarchive.com/dropdown-search.js></script>
