Instead, it arrived in a different cosmos, orbiting an Urnud‚Äëlike world later known as Tro, beginning a prolonged ‚ÄúAdvent.‚Äù In time the vessel was rebuilt to support peoples of both worlds and launched again, reaching Laterre (known on Arbre as <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/antarct>Antarct</a>).<p>From this testimony, a pattern emerges in which the ship is rebuilt at each stop before moving on, with upheaval accompanying these Advents. Durand warns that the Urnud/Tro bloc‚Äîself‚Äëstyled the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a>‚Äîseeks to assess Arbre‚Äôs capabilities and may act pre‚Äëemptively if it believes extraordinary powers are real. He also notes practical constraints, such as incompatible food biology between worlds, that drove the ship‚Äôs mixed provisioning and refits.<p>Statements about its deep history and the intentions of those associated with it are presented here as Durand‚Äôs account rather than established fact.<h2>Configuration and life aboard</h2><p>Laterran accounts describe the living heart of the Daban Urnud as an ‚ÄúOrbstack‚Äù of sixteen hollow spheres clustered about a central axis that rotates to produce pseudogravity. Each sphere is partly filled with water and supports houseboats linked by nets and bladders; when the ship spins or accelerates, the water settles accordingly and the boats are rigged to handle jostling. Trunk lines of optical fibers route captured sunlight from the exterior inward to illuminate rooftop farms. Pressurized corridors allow movement between spheres so that Urnudans, Tro√§ns, Laterrans, and Fthosians can travel among communities. Zero‚Äëgravity sections are dotted with lockers holding respirators, fireproof suits, and extinguishers, reflecting the crew‚Äôs particular caution about fire in weightless spaces.<p>‚Ä¢ Atmosphere and physiology (observed): After an observatory dome was sealed and filled with the visitors‚Äô air, Arbrans who doffed their suits reported pounding heartbeats and rapid breathing before stabilizing. Companions recalled that the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/warden-of-heaven>Warden of Heaven</a> had been the only other Arbran known to breathe it previously and ‚Äúapparently hadn‚Äôt lasted more than a few minutes.‚Äù These are contemporaneous observations and inferences, not a medical analysis.<ul><li>Portals linking adjacent Orbs are generally open during routine conditions and are closed and dogged when the ship maneuvers or accelerates.<li>The ‚Äúsky‚Äù of an Orb is painted blue and lit by a fiber‚Äëoptic ‚Äúsun‚Äù whose apparent motion is created by switching bundles; at night, hard‚Äërouted fiber‚Äëpipes feed cellar grow rooms so crops can grow continuously, enabling population densities comparable to a moderately crowded city using food produced entirely within the Orbs.<li>Houseboat mats form contiguous terraces and gardens connected by public rights‚Äëof‚Äëway across roofs and bowers; heavy goods move by skinny, deep‚Äëdraught gondolas through covered water lanes.<li>Cable‚Äëchair systems run between the houseboat mats and the portal structures ‚Äúin the sky,‚Äù moving people to and from the inter‚ÄëOrb passages.</ul><h2>External architecture and shielding</h2><p>Around the Orbstack, the ship is enclosed in a rubble shield arranged as a faceted icosahedron. The shield is hung on a network of giant shock pistons; the Orbstack is webbed into the middle. Systems that interact with the wider cosmos‚Äîradar, telescopes, weapons, and small craft‚Äîare mounted on the thirty shocks or at the twelve vertices where shocks join. Three vertices near the pusher plate are exposed mechanisms; the other nine are complex vehicles or pressurized nodes. Some contain passage tunnels connecting the icosahedron‚Äôs exterior to interior spaces; one serves as an optical observatory.<p>Additional in‚Äësitu details from the covert approach: - As the craft slews, the terminator creeps across the rubble facets; sunrise and sunset on any given facet are explosively sudden. - The vertex complexes loom like citadels, bristling with parabolic horns that take their turn to face the sun. - Facet rubble does not butt directly against the shock pistons; instead it is ‚Äúsewn‚Äù to piston trusses via zig‚Äëzagging cables over pulleys, allowing the shocks to work. The arrangement, likened by observers to sailboat rigging, is stated to be a mature Urnudan practice. - At each vertex, the shock pistons flare into heavy ‚Äúknuckles,‚Äù and five such knuckles meet to form the base of the vertex complex. - Looking inward through gaps between facet and truss reveals a softly lit interior volume on the order of a few dozen cubic miles, with the sixteen Orbs and the inner walls visible as light scatters within.<h2>Core, Tendons, Nexi, and valves (observed)</h2><ul><li>Tendons: Broad structural/transport shafts link vertex nodes to the ship‚Äôs central Core. An inner corridor a few strides across runs down each Tendon, punctuated by hatches, valves, panels, and displays; the Tendon as a whole is much larger and packed with structure out of sight.<li>Forward bearing chamber: Where Tendons meet the non‚Äërotating end of the Orbstack, a domed chamber houses an immense bearing that joins the stationary icosahedral framework to the spinning Core and Orbstack. During an emergency it filled with soldiers, firefighters, and repair crews moving toward the World Burner Tendon.<li>Ball valves: Major connections are isolated by huge spherical valves with a hole bored through them; when the hole lines up, traffic passes, and when it rotates away, the path is sealed. A ball valve the size of a small house separates the forward bearing chamber from the Core; similar valves sit at the bottoms of the Orb access shafts.<li>Nexi: Four large access shafts open from the Core to the heads of the Orb stacks (Orbs 1, 5, 9, and 13). Around this Nexus lies the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/command-torus>Command Torus</a>, a ring of offices and corridors; it is described as physically partitioned amid the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a>‚Äì<a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a> split.<li>Orb assignment (reported/seen): Orbs One through Four are for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/urnud>Urnud</a>; Five through Eight for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/diasp>Tro</a>; Nine through Twelve for Laterre (<a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/antarct>Antarct</a>); the remainder for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fthos>Fthos</a>. Lower numbers in each stack house higher‚Äëranking members. In passing, Orb 5 was marked for high‚Äëranking Tro√§ns.<li>Rapid transit: Along the Core runs a moving conveyor‚Äëladder used by ship personnel, allowing quick travel ‚Äúup‚Äù one side and ‚Äúdown‚Äù the other; its elastic rungs soften the initial jolt when grabbing on in light spin.<li>Deterrent function (inferred): Observers noted that the ball‚Äëvalve arrangement allows the Command to evacuate the Core and then open a main valve into an Orb, rapidly depressurizing that Orb; regardless of other purposes, the configuration acts as a standing threat in emergencies.</ul><h2>Chronology and Arbran correlation</h2><p>Analysis by an Ita, using captured Urnudan documents and conversion from Urnudan to Arbran units, estimates that the ship‚Äôs first inter‚Äëcosmic departure occurred roughly nine centuries ago in Arbran reckoning, with an uncertainty of a few decades. Some avout have noted that this aligns with the era surrounding the Third Sack; this remains conjectural.<h2>Orbit and surveillance windows</h2><p>Recent in‚Äëorbit observations describe the Daban Urnud on an elliptical path ranging roughly from fourteen to twenty‚Äëfive thousand miles above <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/arbre>Arbre</a>, completing a revolution in about fifteen hours. Because of this geometry, teams in low orbit experience alternating periods of concealment and exposure as line‚Äëof‚Äësight to the ship opens and closes. The ship has short‚Äërange radars suited for nearby objects, but these are not kept active continuously unless visitors are expected; lookouts associated with the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/geometers>Geometers</a> rely on telescopes and syndevs to sift imagery for anomalous objects and non‚Äëballoon orbits.<h2>Current activity on Arbre</h2><p>A covert approach has been launched by S√¶cular authorities working with avout, using personal suits paired with lightweight upper stages. To confuse surveillance, scores of balloons and chaff were lofted alongside humans and cargo, with rendezvous conducted behind a screening balloon during line‚Äëof‚Äësight gaps. The cell assembled a reflective <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/cold-black-mirror>Cold Black Mirror</a> to mask both optical and radar signatures and brought a small service <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/tender>tender</a> online, whose reactor splits water into oxygen and hydrogen to sustain operations. To climb silently toward the Daban Urnud‚Äôs altitude without rocket flares, the team deployed an electrodynamic tether and began a days‚Äëlong spiral under continuous low thrust.<p>As the final approach neared, a sextant was used to refine orbital elements, and the tether was cut at a precise alignment to synchronize the orbit with the ship. After pushing the Mirror away to clear the view, the team advanced in matte‚Äëblack suits and used grapnels to snag the wire mesh that binds the rubble shield. With the help of small thrusters, they absorbed the last of their relative velocity and established a firm hold on the Daban Urnud‚Äôs exterior. Several <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/monyafeek>monyafeeks</a> previously used during ascent were cut loose to drift as decoys.<p>Upon reaching a vertex that serves as an optical observatory, operators noted that its split dome functions as a giant airlock. Locally, telescopes are said to be controlled over the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/reticulum>Reticulum</a>; personnel can close the dome halves and pressurize the volume before passing into the pressurized interior via a hatch. An on‚Äëduty Fthosian cosmographer responded when the big scope went dark during sealing.<p>Simultaneously, crews on an illuminated vertex‚Äëmounted installation referred to as the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/world-burner>World Burner</a> were observed in large numbers. A Ringing Vale contingent pushed off in stealth to attempt covert boarding. Moments later, silent flares and a shudder transmitted through the frame suggested a violent event at that site; a companion inferred that propellant tanks had been blown.<p>Inside, responders filled the forward bearing chamber in a rush toward the World Burner Tendon. Amid the confusion, two disguised travelers transited the ball valve into the Core and moved under light spin ‚Äúgravity‚Äù toward the forward Nexus. Later, within Orb One‚Äôs approaches, the activation of so‚Äëcalled <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/everything-killers>Everything Killers</a> was reported, precipitating a lethal emergency.<h2>Status and occupants (reported)</h2><p>Within the shipboard society, communities from Urnud, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/diasp>Tro</a>, Laterre, and <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fthos>Fthos</a> are said to live within the Orbstack, with education geared toward roles in the Command. Political alignments reported by the Laterran source place Urnud and Tro together as the Pedestal, with Fthos opposed and Laterre divided. These particulars are retained here as attributions to that source until independently corroborated.<p>Observed details add that the Orbs are arranged in four stacks of four with lower‚Äënumbered Orbs in each stack housing higher‚Äëranking members; Orb 5 is marked for high‚Äëranking Tro√§ns. The <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/command-torus>Command Torus</a> surrounding the forward Nexus shows physical partitions consistent with a Pedestal‚Äì<a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a> divide.<h2>Leadership and factions (Gan Odru‚Äôs account)</h2><p>A ceremonial meeting in Orb One introduced a robed elder who spoke Orth and identified himself as <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/gan-odru>Gan Odru</a>, the forty‚Äëthird to bear the title ‚ÄúGan.‚Äù In his words, Gan corresponds most closely to ‚ÄúAdmiral‚Äù in Orth: a strategic office responsible for the overall direction of the Daban Urnud and answerable‚Äîwhen such existed‚Äîto civilian authority. Tactical command of specific vessels fell to officers titled Prag (roughly, ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù). Because the ‚Äúfleet‚Äù is now one ship, the traditional Gan‚ÄìPrag relationship has evolved; Odru likened the Gan‚Äôs role to that of avout, and the Prag‚Äôs to the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/saecular-power>S√¶cular Power</a>.<ul><li>Tendencies and names: Odru explained that power cyclically shifts between these roles during long passages. Early in a journey the Gan tends to dominate; over generations, as memories of the quest fade, Prags gain power. The visitors long ago named these opposing tendencies the Pedestal and the Fulcrum. In Odru‚Äôs usage, ‚ÄúFulcrum‚Äù aligns with the Gan‚Äôs strategic outlook, while ‚ÄúPedestal‚Äù aligns with the Prag‚Äôs tactical control.<li>Third Gan and the summons: According to Odru, the third Gan‚Äîillustrious and long‚Äëserving‚Äîrecovered authority ceded to the Prags and, having become aware of a ‚Äúsummons,‚Äù altered the Daban Urnud‚Äôs course to ‚Äúfly into the past.‚Äù The summons was conceived as ancestral voices calling the ship home to make right what had gone wrong. In Odru‚Äôs framing, this can be understood without assuming ancestry, as a flow of information between cosmi (the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/hylaean-flow>Hylaean Flow</a>). The resulting pattern of ‚ÄúAdvents‚Äù at Tro, Earth, and Fthos matches accounts previously attributed to Laterran sources.<li>Warden of Heaven incident (Odru‚Äôs account): When the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/warden-of-heaven>Warden of Heaven</a> was brought aboard, he insisted on removing his suit in a ceremonial room. He became short of breath; physicians tried to reassemble the suit around him and then to use a cold hyperbaric chamber, but he died, Odru saying a major blood vessel had burst. Researchers had already taken blood and tissue samples. <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/prag-eshwar>Prag Eshwar</a>, seeking to tarnish Odru by association with a foolish pretender, chose to return the body in a manner calculated to show contempt.<li>‚ÄúBlood for blood‚Äù plan and Ecba: Those aligned with the Fulcrum conceived an exchange‚Äîsending samples of their own blood down to Arbre. Signals traced by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fraa-orolo>Fraa Orolo</a> and interpreted by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/jules-verne-durand>Jules Verne Durand</a> as an analemma pointed to <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/ecba>Ecba</a>; Durand proposed that delivering the samples there would bear symbolic weight. Ordered elsewhere, he did not go; <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/lise>Lise</a> attempted the mission and, per Odru, was shot while boarding the probe.<li>Escalation and losses: Odru reported that thirty‚Äëone aboard had been slain by fraas and suurs of the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/ringing-vale>Ringing Vale</a> during the crisis around the World Burner and that eighty‚Äëseven more had been herded into a room and the doors welded‚Äîinterpreted by Eshwar as hostages, though avout described it as securing noncombatants. Odru further held that the large bomb, while menacing, was intended as a threat ‚Äúto hang above your planet,‚Äù not to be used; its destruction shook Eshwar for deeper reasons.<li>Current balance: Odru portrayed himself as almost powerless in a place of ceremony while the Prag exerted control elsewhere, consistent with the Pedestal‚Äì<a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a> divide observed in the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/command-torus>Command Torus</a>.</ul><p>These points are recorded here as Odru‚Äôs account to Arbrans during the present dealings with the Daban Urnud. Where motives or internal states are implied, they are attributed to his telling or to avout responses in the moment.<h2>Recent developments and observations</h2><ul><li>Negotiations aboard: Following the detonations and shipboard emergency around the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/world-burner>World Burner</a>, talks were initiated among four parties: the two shipboard tendencies‚Äîthe <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a> and the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a>‚Äîand the two Arbran authorities (the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/saecular-power>S√¶cular Power</a> and the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/mathic-world>Mathic World</a>, then dispersed into the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/antiswarm>Antiswarm</a>). A surface delegation of several dozen was brought aboard by the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/geometers>Geometers</a>, bringing doctors, oxygen, and provisions. These details are recorded from Arbran participants present in those proceedings.<li>Atmosphere, acclimatization, and medical response (observed/related): People who live within a single Orb for long periods reportedly have difficulty spending time in shipwide common areas where a mixed atmosphere is used; others acclimatize over days to weeks. At the optical observatory, a Fthosian cosmographer recognized oxygen‚Äëmismatch symptoms in visiting Arbrans and sounded an alarm. Ship medics responded, placed the visitors on supplemental oxygen, and‚Äîgiven concern about unfamiliar physiology‚Äîused a cold hyperbaric protocol while stabilizing them on the local mix. Later arrivals supplied Arbre‚Äëappropriate oxygen and continued care.<li><p>Vertex standoff and retaking (Arbran account): At the vertex that supports the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/world-burner>World Burner</a>, a Ringing Vale detachment executed a covert action that disabled key systems with three shaped charges. A fourth charge was displayed against a conference‚Äëroom window to compel compliance; Geometer personnel in that room were herded inside and the door welded to keep noncombatants safe. Access into the vertex was locked and welded, and atmosphere was vented so the area could only be approached in suits. After roughly two days, Urnudan forces retook the vertex by breaching a wall, venting the remaining air; two infiltrators died there of exposure. Others in the detachment were killed earlier in fighting on the lattice or by debris during the detonations. These particulars are preserved here as in‚Äëworld accounts from Arbran participants.</p><li><p>Opening ceremonies and accord signing in Orb Four: The Urnudan residential orb contains a plaza encircling an elliptical pool with four surrounding pavilions; simultaneous interpretation was provided from mezzanines. Delegations from the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a>, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a>, the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/saecular-power>S√¶cular Power</a>, and the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/mathic-world>Mathic World</a> convened here. Funerary rites preceded proceedings, with remains transferred across the water and a formal handover observed.
