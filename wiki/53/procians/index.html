In the same milieu, an entry for the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/incanter>Incanter</a> cites a popular pairing of fictional “Rhetors” (said to be linked to Procians) with their supposed foes; the citation is attributed to <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/the-dictionary>The Dictionary</a> (4th edition, A.R. 3000).<h2>Roles/Actions and Affiliations</h2><p>Within the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/mathic-world>Mathic World</a> (cloistered scholarly sphere), the name ties to <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/saunt-proc>Saunt Proc</a> and the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/syntactic-faculty-of-the-concent-of-saunt-muncoster>Syntactic Faculty of the Concent (monastic community) of Saunt Muncoster</a>. Avout (cloistered scholars) also use <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/procian>Procian</a> as a label for a posture in interpretation and argument. Visitors from extramuros (outside the walls) who study under Procians are noted to go on to careers in law, communications, politics, or commerce. At Saunt Baritoe, the order is described as “Procian-dominated”; within its Unarian math, Procians train many young Saeculars (non-avout outsiders) who later enter law, politics, and commerce.<h3>Presence at the Convox</h3><p>During a grand convocation at Tredegarh, a leading Procian conducted a Plenary in the Unarian nave using an extemporaneous dialog format. Fraa Lodoghir—identified there as the First Among Equals of the Centenarian Chapter of the Order of Saunt Proc at Muncoster—served as loctor and framed a cohesive narrative hypothesis about recent events for an audience that included avout and Sæcular officials. His rhetorical jibes drew knowing laughter from Procian listeners even as others objected, underscoring the order’s active role in shaping how current happenings are interpreted.<p>At the first Plurality of Worlds messal hosted at Avrachon’s Dowment, Fraa Lodoghir referred to himself as the “token Procian” and advanced a Procian framing: that language and thought are manipulations of symbols whose meanings are assigned by culture; until Arbre shares experiences and culture with the Geometers, communication with them will be unreliable. He argued that the messal should develop—working with the Sæcular Power—a strategy to create a shared language and thereby break down that plurality. Several participants pushed back (one response was “According to Procians!”), and a Sæcular official later complained that the discussion had drifted into an old Procian-versus-Halikaarnian dispute.<p>Later, in a messal focused on metatheorics and the Hylaean Theoric World, Fraa Lodoghir addressed an earlier Procian suggestion raised at a Plenary that the diagram of the Adrakhonic Theorem on the Geometers’ ship had been inserted into Saunt Orolo’s phototype. With new high‑resolution phototypes showing the diagram clearly, he acknowledged that the hypothesis was incorrect and withdrew it.<h2>Leadership and Organization</h2><ul><li>Offices and chapters: The order is shown to include at least a Centenarian Chapter at Saunt Muncoster, headed by a “First Among Equals” (FAE). In the account available, Fraa Lodoghir holds this office.<li>Convox protocol: In Convox logistics, Lodoghir acted as a doyn and assigned a non‑Procian avout as his servitor for the duration, illustrating how Procian leaders may operate within convocation hierarchies.</ul><h2>Relationships (as relevant)</h2><ul><li>Patronage and lineage: Associated by name with Saunt Proc and, historically, with the syntactic line of study.<li>Perceived counterparts: In popular iconography, “Rhetors” are paired against figures like the Incanter; some stories make further claims about influence in other maths. Such depictions are presented as stock portrayals rather than reports of practice.</ul><h2>Descriptions/Characteristics (as relevant)</h2><p>The singular “Procian” appears in avout speech as a descriptor for a certain interpretive bent. No formal doctrine, rites, distinctive garb, or leadership have been described in the material available. In avout discussion, certain metatheorics aligned with this lineage are described in Procian terms as “a sort of religion.” In current avout debate, Procians are said to deride interest in the Hylaean Theoric World (theoric ideal realm)—using that label as a backhanded way to imply naivete—and their stance is contrasted with doctrines like <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/protism>Protism</a>.<p>Speakers sometimes joke about a “Procian camp” when a non‑Procian seems to edge toward their position. In ongoing messals on metatheorics, observers have even remarked that “a Procian and a Halikaarnian” were on the verge of agreeing, highlighting that practical debate can blur lines between schools.<h2>Background and Antecedents</h2><p>According to a cited entry in The Dictionary, the ancient current called <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/sphenics>Sphenics</a> are forerunners of Saunt Proc, the Syntactic Faculties, and the Procians, aligning this order’s lineage with long‑running disputes over whether theorics engages an external ideal realm.<p>A separate Dictionary headword for “Syntactic Faculties” describes post‑Reconstitution factions that claim descent from Proc as treating language and theorics as games played with symbols that lack inherent semantic content; Procians are situated within that lineage.<h2>Metatheorics and the Split</h2><p>In avout discussion after the Reconstitution, Procians are described as more friendly to the syntactic point of view in debates over the Aboutness Problem. Some speakers equate this tendency with "Faanians," referencing a later leader who served as FAE of the Syntactic Faculty at the Concent of Saunt Muncoster. In this telling, Procians treat Aboutness—semantic content over and above ones and zeroes—as an illusion produced by sufficiently advanced syntactic devices. Their counterparts in the lineage of Halikaarn and Evenedric argue that Aboutness is real and irreducible.<h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>In a discussion of consciousness and quantum effects, Orolo characterizes most people—Procians and Halikaarnians alike—as likely to treat such ideas as idle metatheorics (theory about theories). This usage frames the label here as signaling intellectual background rather than a specific stance on that topic.</ul><h2>Later Mentions and Perception</h2><ul><li>During later preparations for a risky space mission, one non‑Procian joked that, if a task only required a diversion bound to end badly, they could “just send Procians.” The quip—met with bemusement rather than agreement—shows how the label functions in intra‑mathic banter and rivalry; it should not be read as an official view of the order’s role or value.<li>In a separate theorical exchange that connected a timeline of off‑world voyaging to events on Arbre, speakers suggested that, during the decades surrounding the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/third-sack>Third Sack</a>, practitioners across schools—including Procians and <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/halikaarnians>Halikaarnians</a>—worked on a powerful, controversial praxis. According to this in‑world account, many records were destroyed and many practitioners were killed, with fragments possibly preserved in the Three Inviolates. These claims are presented as conjecture based on fragmentary evidence and personal inference, not as settled history.<li>As boundaries were being staked and claims asserted around a new headquarters for one of the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/magisteria>Magisteria</a> at the crater named for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fraa-orolo>Fraa Orolo</a>, observers described “a small army of Procians” aiding with public-facing argumentation against lawyers engaged on the other side.<li>On the same occasion, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fraa-lodoghir>Fraa Lodoghir</a> appeared, with remarks that his presence would likely ensure an influential Procian faculty in the foundation taking shape there.</ul><h2>Current Status/Location</h2><p>Active as a recognized name and tradition within the maths. Representatives of the order, including the FAE at Muncoster, are present and influential at major assemblies and, more recently, around the nascent headquarters on the island within the crater named for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/fraa-orolo>Fraa Orolo</a>. Procian voices are heard in on‑site debates and practical advocacy as boundaries and roles are defined within the two <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/53/magisteria>Magisteria</a>; no distinctive dress or domicile unique to the order has been specified.</div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>An order within the mathic world associated by name and interpretive stance with Saunt Proc and the syntactic tradition.
