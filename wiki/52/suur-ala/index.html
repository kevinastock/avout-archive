She chose the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/order-of-the-new-circle>New Circle</a> at Eliger, helped set up a discreet pinhole projection of the sun with close peers, and was later named during <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/voco>Voco</a> (formal summons out of a math). Reports from Tredegarh place her at the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/convox>Convox</a> (rare mass assembly) now underway.<h2>Appearance and Traits</h2><p>Forthright, brisk, and decisive. Small and bony, with a round head, large eyes, a delicate sharp nose, and a wide mouth; she keeps her hair cropped short. Her manner shifts easily from command to collaboration when a practical path is clear. She shows tactful modesty and keeps others on task when duties press.<h2>Roles and Actions</h2><ul><li>Bell work and mentoring: organizes and rehearses ringers, spends time in the Mynsterâ€™s lower works maintaining mechanisms and practicing unfamiliar changes, and passes techniques to younger girls.<li>Discreet observation: with Suur Tulia, darkened a maintenance room beneath the carillon to project the sun safely. Together with <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fraa-erasmas>Fraa Erasmas</a>, marked brief blueâ€‘white "sparks" on the projected disk for later analysis.<li>Nightâ€‘sky observation (recalled): Erasmas later remarks that he and Ala saw bright flashes overhead, which he interprets as nuclear drive bursts associated with a change in the orbit of the visitorsâ€™ craft; this interpretation is his.<li>Convox risk mitigation and the Antiswarm: Ala states she was assigned by senior SÃ¦cular officials to plan risk mitigation for the Convox. She preâ€‘assigns all participants to dispersal cells and meets with cell leaders to walk through contingencies. Each cell is to include some <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/ita>Ita</a> so that, when dispersed, groups remain connected over the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/reticulum>Reticulum</a>; this relaxes customary avout/Ita separation and anticipates praxic tasks of immediate SÃ¦cular relevance. Openâ€‘air distribution of rucksacks and activation badges served as a deliberate deterrence signal intended to show the visitors (now labeled "PAQD") that Tredegarh can scatter at a momentâ€™s notice; when triggered, badges will direct avout to their cell rendezvous.<li>Cellâ€‘leader Lucubs and outreach debate: followâ€‘up Lucubs for especially inquisitive cell leaders converged on the view that contact should be made with a faction of the visitors even if barred by SÃ¦cular channels. Proposals under discussion include using observatoriesâ€™ guidestar lasers for narrowâ€‘beam signals; within the narrative, this laser idea is attributed to Orolo.<li>Breakfast exchange: At an openâ€‘air meal amid Convox preparations, Ala tells Erasmas she has been organizing people and that plans predated the Convoxâ€™s formation; she notes "PAQD" has replaced "Geometers" in current usage. Parting quickly to continue duties, she says she has made a terrible decisionâ€”likened to Oroloâ€™s choice before the gates of Orithenaâ€”with the sense of "terrible but right."<li>Execution of the Antiswarm: When a dispersal order is triggered at Tredegarh, Alaâ€™s preparations take effect. Badges activate with individualized routes; controlled demolitions open multiple exits; aid teams, sound trucks, and drivers guide evacuees to drummons and coaches assigned to their cells. Participants describe the evacuation as bearing her stamp in its clarity and effectiveness.<li>Orbital mission selection and oversight (reported): According to <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/suur-tulia>Tulia</a>, after a cell was launched into orbit Ala became a central figure in ongoing coordination with senior officials. Peers credit her with helping make the case for an avoutâ€‘led teamâ€”citing <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/jules-verne-durand>Jules Verne Durand</a>â€™s Orth and the need for broadly trained, adaptable participants. While the cell travels, she is described as focusing attention on what the team should do on arrival at the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>. These attributions are reported by peers and not direct statements from Ala.<li>Difficult choice and cell composition: Erasmas interprets the makeup of one cell led by Lio as the outcome of Alaâ€™s "terrible but right" choice to concentrate trusted peers so they could support one another; before departure he asks that a message be relayed to her acknowledging her judgment. This is presented as his inference.<li>Strategic intent and alleged hidden measures (as discussed in orbit): Members of the orbiting team state that Ala would not sanction turning avout into carriers for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/everything-killers>Everything Killers</a>; Erasmas says this outright. Lio argues that, if such measures are part of the wider plan, they were added without Alaâ€™s knowledge. Fraa Osa outlines how a lead strategist might instead have tasked Ala to assemble a team able to seek sympathizers among the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/geometers>Geometers</a> opposed to the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a>. These are statements by others, not direct claims from Ala.<li>Delegation aide aboard the Daban Urnud: Travels with a delegation to the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a> for fourâ€‘way talks among the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a>, the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a>, and the Magisteria. She describes herself as a "wallâ€‘crawler" (aide); the group brings physicians, oxygen, and food for Arbrans undergoing treatment aboard.<li>Rewarming and debrief: Present during Erasmasâ€™s recovery under an Arbran physicianâ€™s care, Ala helps calm and warm him and then briefs him on events aboard the ship, including the Valersâ€™ seizure of a vertex and the wrecking of the World Burner. She reports that <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fraa-osa>Fraa Osa</a> and <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/suur-esma>Suur Esma</a> secured hostages and later died when the area was vented, that <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/suur-vay>Suur Vay</a> was killed fighting during the approach, and that <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fraa-gratho>Fraa Gratho</a> was killed by debris. These are her accounts of events relayed to her. She also shows practical discretion by stepping out to give him privacy while he dresses and later reminding him to keep his earbud in as formalities begin.<li>Advance delegation staging at Orb Four: As part of the earlyâ€‘arriving Arbran contingent, Ala is seen shuttling between a makeshift inflatable pavilion used by senior officials and the staging area, coordinating via a headset during the opening ceremonies.<li>Funeral honors at Orb Four: Guides Erasmas to join as a pallbearer and cues a familiar Requiem chant from Edhar for the aut honoring the dead, helping keep the procession orderly during the formal transfer across the water.</ul><h2>Relationships and Affiliations</h2><ul><li>Suur Tulia: longâ€‘standing working partner in chores, bell work, and quiet study; Tulia had set out intending to find Ala at Saunt Tredegarh.<li>Fraa Erasmas: collaborator on the pinhole observation. The two agreed to declare an Etrevanean liaison (formal relationship rite) that was not entered before later events. Erasmas has sent mail care of Tredegarh addressed to Ala; they speak briefly during the Convox about her current responsibilities. Later, as groups go to ground and prepare for operations away from Tredegarh, he asks the Ita Sammann to relay another message to Ala over the Reticulum, expressing that, if granted a "fourth life," he wishes to spend it with her. While in orbit he also composes additional messages addressed to Ala for retrieval if his suit is recovered. Aboard the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>, they reunite during his recovery; she comforts him and then shares an account of recent events before returning to her aide duties.<li><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fraa-jesry>Fraa Jesry</a>: Jesry states that after their Voco he and Ala began a liaison; he expects she will decide next steps and remain out of contact until she has done so.<li>Lio: confidant who reports on her roles during the Convox and recruits others to discussions; he says she started the Lucub network noted above.<li><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/panjandrum>Panjandrums</a>: senior SÃ¦cular officials with whom she confers during the Convox; her riskâ€‘mitigation assignment comes through them.</ul><h2>Current Status</h2><p>Now present aboard the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a> as part of a delegation supporting fourâ€‘way talks among the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a>, the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a>, and the Magisteria. The group brings physicians, oxygen, and provisions for Arbrans being treated on the ship. During Erasmasâ€™s rewarming she is at his side and later checks in with the physician overseeing care. She remains engaged as a "wallâ€‘crawler" (aide) while the talks proceed and while Erasmas continues his recovery.</div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>Ala is a young suur of the Concent of Saunt Edhar known for practical leadership and bell work who organized riskâ€‘mitigation for the Antiswarm dispersal.
