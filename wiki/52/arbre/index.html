The name anchors formal dating in the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/a-r>A.R.</a> era (Reconstitution‚Äëbased calendar). Accounts describe long‚Äëterm climatic swings and migrations after the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/terrible-events>Terrible Events</a>, with communities adapting to arid basins, irrigated valleys, and mountain terraces.<h2>Notable Features</h2><ul><li>Sea of Seas: a relatively small but intricate saltwater basin linked to the great oceans by three straits, widely treated as the cradle of classical civilization.<li>Continents: traditions differ on counting Arbre‚Äôs continents, with some sources using ten historical names and others recognizing seven; the discrepancy traces to ancient naming around the Sea of Seas and to far‚Äënorthern land that wraps over the pole and connects regions once thought separate.<li>Skywatching infrastructure: many maths maintain roofline observatories such as the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/starhenge>Starhenge</a>; orreries commonly include a lapis sphere representing Arbre.<li>S√¶cular networks (civil‚Äëworld infrastructure): paved highways, freight traffic, and a navigation‚Äësatellite system used by cartablas. Reports note that portions of the road network outside major towns can be rough or degraded and that, on a recent morning, devices across a wide region failed to obtain fixes (cause unconfirmed).<li>Polar overland route: at extreme northern latitudes, sledge ports dispatch over‚Äëice trains that haul freight (and sometimes vehicles and travelers) between northern lands when markets and conditions permit; caravans of drummons feed these ports from the ‚Äúdeep ruins‚Äù country.<li>Terrain and land use: lower mountain slopes in some regions support fuel‚Äëtree plantations served by dirt logging roads and heavy trucks; higher elevations open into wild country with tarns, old tracks, and disused structures such as abandoned fortresses and cabins. These areas are sparsely settled and used seasonally for hunting and camping.<li>Orithena on Ecba: an ancient temple site and dual‚Äëwalled complex <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/orithena>Orithena</a> on the volcanic island of <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/ecba>Ecba</a>. A cloistered community there presents outwardly as avout while identifying internally as a Lineage (pre‚ÄëCartasian tradition); excavation is organized in cool hours, orchards supply food along the slope, and hot springs feed bath‚Äëhouses. Breezes off the sea and ash‚Äëfused masonry are noted features, and local trees are described as the oldest living on Arbre.<li>Orbital and upper‚Äëatmosphere environment: at low altitudes near a hundred miles, an object circles Arbre in roughly ninety minutes. Ascent accounts note a bright blue limb and, at high velocity in the thinning air, visible plasma against edges of nearby structures. The ionosphere conducts and Arbre‚Äôs magnetic field is sufficient for a long current‚Äëcarrying tether to generate gentle, continuous thrust. Orbiting teams also report use of a sextant‚Äëlike device that recognizes constellations and, combined with the positions of the sun, the moon, and Arbre plus an ephemeris, yields orbital elements for navigation.</ul><h2>Associations</h2><ul><li>Calendrical and institutional: Arbre‚Äôs cycles frame observance in the A.R. system and the mathic calendar.<li>Cultural landmarks: references to the ‚ÄúThree Inviolates‚Äù commonly point to maths at the Concent of Saunt Edhar, Saunt Rambalf‚Äôs math, and the Concent of Saunt Tredegarh.<li>Terminology and time units: ‚ÄúArbran‚Äù is commonly used as the adjectival/demonymic form (e.g., ‚ÄúArbran years‚Äù). During current preparations, theors derived a working conversion between local years and ‚ÄúUrnudan years‚Äù using timestamps in documents captured from Matarrhite quarters and reference events on Arbre. This suggests the visitors‚Äô first inter‚Äëcosmic departure occurred roughly 910 Arbran years earlier (¬±20), overlapping with the era leading up to the Third Sack. These figures are treated as estimates rather than confirmed disclosure.<li>Atmosphere and acclimatization (observed/medical accounts): Aboard the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/daban-urnud>Daban Urnud</a>, Arbrans breathing mixed air derived from other worlds (e.g., <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/antarct>Laterre</a>) report altitude‚Äëlike symptoms until acclimatization occurs; after a week or two, most can tolerate it. Some residents of the Orbstack rarely leave their home orb because of these air differences. For visiting Arbrans, oxygen from Arbre is being supplied on board.</ul><h2>Recent Activity</h2><ul><li>Contact at Orithena: witnesses on Ecba describe a parachute‚Äëretarded, rocket‚Äëbraked probe descending over the temple and settling onto the tiled forecourt known as The Decagon. Orithena residents opened a hatch and recovered a humanoid visitor ‚Äúnot from Arbre,‚Äù together with a sealed case of labeled blood tubes. S√¶cular responders in protective suits arrived, issued tracking collars, and jammed the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/reticulum>Reticulum</a> (planetary network). Shortly afterward, observers saw a high‚Äëvelocity object enter the volcano‚Äôs cap above the site, followed by an orange, glowing pyroclastic cloud that overran Orithena; many people were evacuated by aerocraft. Participants attribute the strike to the orbital <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/geometers>Geometers</a> (off‚Äëworld visitors) and report signs of disagreement among them; others note that formal confirmation is pending.<li>Orbital object: ground and instrument observers describe an icosahedral object in Arbre‚Äëcentered orbit. Features noted include a network of edge members meeting at rounded vertices and, on at least one face, markings laid out as a geometric construction akin to a proof. A separate inscription on a forward strut uses characters resembling, but not identical to, familiar alphabets. Observers note that the craft keeps a broad ‚Äúpusher plate‚Äù oriented toward Arbre as a shield, limiting ground‚Äëbased views of forward structures. Within avout circles, some have begun calling the presumed visitors the ‚ÄúCousins.‚Äù<li>Narrow‚Äëbeam illumination: on at least one night, a red beam from the object illuminated prominent maths; examples shown publicly included Saunt Rambalf‚Äôs and Saunt Tredegarh‚Äôs. In dialog among travelers, a Thousander (avout of the Thousanders order) reports that long‚Äëterm waste repositories exist beneath Edhar‚Äôs crag, with similar sites at Rambalf and Tredegarh; others treat this as sensitive and not publicly confirmed.<li>Systems effects: contemporaneous reports also mentioned a navigation‚Äësatellite outage; explanations circulating range from festival interference to deliberate disruption, none verified.<li>Planetary sentiment: travelers describe a surge of world‚Äëlevel identification and concern‚Äîspeaking of feeling like ‚Äúcitizens of the world‚Äù‚Äîin response to the orbital craft‚Äôs appearance; some invoke laments for the Third Sack when imagining worst‚Äëcase outcomes.<li>Convox (worldwide mathic convocation): a large gathering of avout (cloistered scholars) from concents (walled monastic complexes) across Arbre‚Äîtogether with S√¶cular (civil) officials‚Äîhas assembled at Saunt Tredegarh in response to the visitors. Attendees describe its proceedings as political and driven by compromise; a cited dictionary notes such Convox are normally held at a Millennial Apert (gate‚Äëopening) or after a sack and may also be convened, in exceptional circumstances, at the request of the S√¶cular Power.<li>Laser‚Äëcolor anomaly and matter analysis: a cosmographer at Saunt Rambalf exposed a photomnemonic tablet to the red beam and obtained its exact wavelength; specialists report it matches no naturally occurring spectral line. Laboratory work on fragments and a recovered body indicates ‚Äúnewmatter‚Äù (synthetic nuclei altering chemistry), which some use to argue that cross‚Äëinfection risk is minimal for either side; quarantine practices are under review by authorities.<li>Four‚Äësample divergence (current discussion): reports circulating among attendees at Tredegarh describe tests on the four fluid vials recovered at Ecba showing that each sample‚Äôs nuclei are mutually incompatible with the others and with Arbre‚Äënative matter. Many now discuss this as evidence that the visitors originate from distinct cosmi (or ‚Äúworldtracks‚Äù), rather than as a propulsion‚Äëinduced ‚Äúnewmatter‚Äù effect. Informal nicknames in use for the four are ‚ÄúAntarct,‚Äù ‚ÄúPangee,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiasp,‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuator.‚Äù<li>Tredegarh Precipice arrangement: accounts describe tunnels beneath Tredegarh‚Äôs Precipice for nuclear‚Äëwaste storage and claim that its Inviolateness stems from a long‚Äëstanding arrangement between the mathic world (monastic‚Äëscholar communities) and the S√¶cular Power (civil authority), rather than fortifications; this is treated as sensitive information.<li>Coordinated observation and satellite gambit: following an influential messal after the Visitation at Orithena, S√¶cular planners quietly repositioned a long‚Äësilent reconnaissance ‚Äúbird‚Äù from synchronous orbit onto a trajectory designed to force the hedron to turn its shield toward a radioactive approach vector, enabling ground‚Äëbased instruments to image its forward sections. Observatories across Arbre prepared to watch at the appointed time. Witnesses then reported a brief, pinpoint flash where the intercept should have occurred; some onlookers identified it as a directed‚Äëenergy strike from the object (one called it an ‚ÄúX‚Äëray laser‚Äù). Senior officials sheltered in bunkers as a precaution, while mathic communities noted their experience with nuclear‚Äëaftermath coping should the attempt provoke retaliation.<li>Potential ‚ÄúWorld Burner‚Äù device (working inference): close analysis of the new images identifies a detachable grey ‚Äúegg‚Äù mounted on a shock‚Äëabsorber strut by oversized brackets. Calculations on the bracket dimensions imply the pod is extraordinarily massive‚Äîconsistent with a fissionable payload far beyond known Arbran devices. Observers infer it could be maneuvered into an orbit opposite the main craft and, if detonated, flood a visible hemisphere of Arbre with radiant energy; this possibility is why some speakers now nickname it a <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/world-burner>World Burner</a>. These readings are presented as working inferences rather than confirmed disclosure.<li>Independent contact proposals: private lucubs have discussed using observatory guidestar lasers to send tightly aimed signals directly to the icosahedron, difficult to intercept off‚Äëbeam. Reports say some Ita support the technical arrangements. The same circles debate whether to pursue dialogue specifically with one visitor faction based on laboratory hints and field observations; others warn that such moves run counter to the post‚ÄëReconstitution settlement.<li>Historical research notes: some Laboratory groups have been assigned to review very old technical documents‚Äîspecifications, manuals, and sketches‚Äîdating from just before the Terrible Events. Participants believe these concern so‚Äëcalled ‚ÄúEverything Killers,‚Äù a category of weapons remembered in dictionaries and folk history; the prospect of reviving such praxis is controversial and has prompted talk of a ‚Äúpost‚Äëmathic‚Äù turn and even a ‚ÄúSecond Rebirth‚Äù in some quarters.<li>Protected‚Äëroom disclosure and evacuation at Tredegarh: in a grounded‚Äëmesh ‚ÄúBucker‚Äôs Basket,‚Äù a doyn dropped his Matarrhite guise and identified himself as a linguist from Laterre while naming his minder as from Urnud; he described internal divisions among the visitors and fear of Arbre‚Äôs rumored Incanters. Shortly thereafter, Tredegarh initiated a controlled, night‚Äëtime evacuation of the Convox, using rucksack badges for routing, blasted apertures in the ancient wall to create exits, staging drummons across the glacis, and airlift to move designated cells.<li>Coordinated low‚Äëorbit operation and decoys: a timed salvo of many small missiles lofted balloons, radar‚Äëchaff, and mixed payloads into low orbit. Teams used Arbre‚Äôs bulk to slip out of the Daban Urnud‚Äôs line of sight, hiding behind balloons to rendezvous and assemble equipment while the Geometers were forced to sift decoys. Later movements were screened by a cold, reflective surface intended to bounce sensors and minimize heat signature.<li>Orbital ‚Äúrod‚Äù strikes on equatorial launch facilities: during a night‚Äëside pass, observers in low orbit saw brilliant linear traces descending to major launch complexes around the equator, each followed by a hemispherical bloom of light. The effect was compared to a nuclear flash without fallout and matches descriptions of dense kinetic projectiles (‚Äúrods‚Äù). Attribution to the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/pedestal-urnud-tro-axis>Pedestal</a> is a working inference voiced in‚Äëworld; formal confirmation has not been given.<li>Reticulum integrity anomaly and surveillance capture (current reports): orbiting observers describe a reputon‚Äëspace fault that led to inconsistent or contradictory status messages among ground support cells and the automatic creation of prioritized audio/video recordings when sensitive topics were discussed; to prevent unintended leakage while the issue is unresolved, their transmitter was physically disabled.<li>Boarding action and observatory entry (current operations): a mixed Arbran team‚Äîincluding members of the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/valers>Valers</a>‚Äîreached the Daban Urnud, traversed facets of its rubble‚Äëshielded icosahedron in stealth, and observed many suited workers swarming over the presumed World Burner. Four Vale specialists covertly boarded the device while others entered an optical observatory dome that functions as a large airlock; after pressurization, operatives breathed shipboard air and moved inward via a Tendon toward the rotating Core.<li>Onboard flashes and radiative event (reported from orbit): near the World Burner complex, observers saw a boiling flare consistent with propellant‚Äëtank destruction; later, during a confrontation inside the ship‚Äôs Urnudan VIP sphere, an <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/everything-killers>Everything Killer</a> was triggered by an Arbran, producing a lethal burst within the vessel. In‚Äëmission framing presents these actions as intended to prevent the World Burner‚Äôs launch against Arbre.<li>Visitor account and internal factions (newly reported): In a formal audience inside the icosahedron, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/gan-odru>Gan Odru</a> (a ‚ÄúGan,‚Äù akin to an admiral aboard the Daban Urnud) described a long‚Äëstanding split between strategic Gans and tactical Prags, mirrored by tendencies called the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fulcrum>Fulcrum</a> and the Pedestal. He said the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/warden-of-heaven>Warden of Heaven</a> removed his suit in a ceremonial chamber, suffered acute breathing difficulty, and died of a ruptured vessel despite a hyperbaric attempt; researchers took samples and an autopsy followed before the body was returned, fueling outrage on Arbre. According to this account, a ‚Äúblood for blood‚Äù gesture from the Fulcrum sent blood samples down to Orithena via a probe; the boarding was undertaken by a woman later identified in‚Äëworld as Lise after a linguist who had prepared for Orth contact was reassigned, and she was shot while departing. Odru also stated that a Ringing Vale team killed thirty‚Äëone aboard and sealed eighty‚Äëseven others in a room for safety‚Äîinterpreted by the Prag as hostage‚Äëtaking‚Äîand presented the destroyed heavy device as a deterrent intended to hang overhead rather than be fired. In the same discussion, Odru and an avout spoke of the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/hylaean-flow>Hylaean Flow</a> and of visions reported by a much earlier Gan that now seem to match later devastation remembered on Arbre; whether such signals were sent or simply perceived remains an open question in‚Äëworld.<li>Antiswarm dispersal (named by the Ita): after infiltration was unmasked at Tredegarh and evacuation procedures were demonstrated, mathic communities dispersed into the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/antiswarm>Antiswarm</a>‚Äîa network of pre‚Äëassigned cells meant to keep work going while deterring attack by showing readiness to scatter.<li>Four‚Äëway talks aboard the Daban Urnud (current): following the destruction around the World Burner and a tense vertex lockdown, off‚Äëworld leaders called for talks among the Pedestal, the Fulcrum, and the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/magisteria>Magisteria</a> (the Mathic world together with the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/saecular-power>S√¶cular Power</a>). An Arbran delegation‚Äîdescribed as several dozen including physicians‚Äîtraveled to the Daban Urnud with oxygen and supplies to support the conference.<li>Off‚Äëworld characterization of the ‚Äúrods‚Äù: accounts from Arbran delegates interacting with shipboard personnel describe the equatorial launch‚Äësite strikes as a Pedestal action following a decoy missile salvo; in‚Äëstory, this is treated as their report of the attackers‚Äô viewpoint rather than a formal admission.<li>Opening ceremonies and remains protocol (aboard): At a meeting pool in an Urnudan orb, an honor guard ferried coffins across the water as delegations gathered. The four fallen <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/valers>Valers</a> were formally entrusted‚Äîundisturbed‚Äîto Arbran custody, while <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/lise>Lise</a>‚Äôs coffin was borne by barge to the Laterran pavilion for private mourning by friends and by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/jules-verne-durand>Jules Verne Durand</a>. Brief words of remembrance were offered from opposite shores by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/gan-odru>Gan Odru</a> and <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/fraa-lodoghir>Fraa Lodoghir</a>, and Arbrans sang a solemn chant.<li>Peace signing on the water: Immediately afterward, four leaders embarked on a barge and co‚Äësigned a peace instrument at the pool‚Äôs center: <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/gan-odru>Gan Odru</a>, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/prag-eshwar>Prag Eshwar</a>, an Arbran minister, and a <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/thousanders>Thousander</a> representing the avout. The proceeding marked a shift from emergency talks toward formal terms among the shipboard tendencies and the Magisteria.<li>Delegation composition (glimpsed aboard): Observers note a mixed Arbran roster that includes physicians and translators, avout and Ita, military officers, and S√¶cular officials and aides‚Äîamong them <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/ignetha-foral>Ignetha Foral</a>, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/magnath-foral>Magnath Foral</a>, and <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/52/emman-beldo>Emman Beldo</a>‚Äîwith Arbre‚Äëappropriate oxygen and supplies staged for use during the proceedings.</ul><h2>Status/Access</h2><p>Arbre is active and inhabited across both cloistered concents (walled monastic complexes) and the S√¶cular world. Travel conditions vary widely by region and era of maintenance, from well‚Äëkept highways to broken ‚Äúnew gravel‚Äù stretches in the countryside. Crossing between continent‚Äëscale political units under the S√¶cular Power typically requires documents, which avout do not generally hold; over‚Äëice sledge routes at high latitude provide one practical path between northern lands without passing through sea or air ports of entry.
