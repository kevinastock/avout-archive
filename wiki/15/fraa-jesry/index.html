He assembles in the crowded Tenner corner before entering the chancel for Provener. In recollection of an earlier late‑summer assignment to walk the meadow for prohibited plants, Jesry and Fraa Lio discovered a patch that led to a spreading blaze; it was Chronicled as an accident and penances were assigned. During the opening he accompanies a peer outside the walls for a first walk extramuros in many years.<h2>Roles/Actions and Affiliations</h2><p>Jesry is an <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/15/avout>Avout</a> of the Decenarian Math within the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/15/concent-of-saunt-edhar>Concent of Saunt Edhar</a>. He serves on the four‑person clock‑winding team in the Mynster, working the capstan alongside peers. In conversation during the opening, he states that he has been computing for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/15/fraa-orolo>Fraa Orolo</a>'s group, describing the work as orbital mechanics carried out praxically. During the opening he asked whether a peer's newly designed wrap could stop bullets; that blunt question prompted <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/15/fraa-lio>Fraa Lio</a> to take acquaintances to an abandoned quarry and perform live‑fire tests on his bolt and sphere. He goes extramuros with a peer to survey neighborhoods near the gates and later returns to take part in Provener. At the communal Tenth Night supper, he acted as an informal host—seating his family at a neighboring table and drawing Orolo into their cluster for conversation.<h2>Relationships</h2><ul><li><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/15/fraa-erasmas>Fraa Erasmas</a> — peer within the Tenners; they coordinate duties, walk outside together during the opening, and support injured teammates in making it through Provener.<li>Peers: works closely with Fraa Lio and Fraa Arsibalt on the winding team; present when they returned injured from an attack outside the walls and while questions were taken by a warden.<li>Family: from a burgers household near the concent. At his family home he found a servant and a note from his mother explaining she had gone to join his father for obligations tied to the Saecular Power, with intentions for the family to attend a banquet on Tenth Night; the message referred to three older brothers and two older sisters. As his family filtered back into town during the opening, he visited them; the account’s narrator remarked on their intelligence, polish, and evident material abundance. His mother studied for two years at the Unarian Math around age twenty; his father—somewhat older—studied three years there before their marriage and later used that training in his career. During the opening, they hosted a reception for him at their house. At the Tenth Night supper beneath the canopy, Jesry seated his family adjacent to his peer group, tried to rein in an older brother whose jeejah rang during the proceedings, and later spoke up in defense of a peer when that brother tried to shush him; his father listened closely to the mayor’s formal remarks and took notes. In discussion, Jesry corrected his brother by noting that the iconography at issue predated the founding of the city‑state of Ethras.<li>Cord: meets the narrator’s sib at a machine hall outside the walls and later is with her when she observes the clock from within the Mynster precincts.</ul><h2>Descriptions/Characteristics</h2><p>Physically strong from clock duty and, by peers’ account, the most athletic‑looking among his cohort. When he does play sports he is determined and quick to anger but effective. In conversation he can be blunt and analytical, sometimes hard to talk to, and he expresses a desire for “something to happen” rather than settling for comfort. He is regarded as strong in theorics and is practical‑minded about praxes. During an extramuros walk he briefly joked about picking a fight but did not pursue it. At table he shows dry, quick wit—for example, quipping about glibness only after an older, respected avout has pointed it out—and he readily stands up for peers during tense moments.<h2>Current Status/Location</h2><p>Active among the Tenners in the Decenarian Math at the Concent of Saunt Edhar. During the present opening he has walked outside the walls, visited his family, and returned to duties including clock winding and participation in Provener. He continues contributing calculations for a cosmography effort noted above. He is present beneath the canopy during Tenth Night, seated with family and peers.</div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>A Tenner-level avout of the Decenarian Math at the Concent of Saunt Edhar and a peer of Fraa Erasmas.
