He favors first-principles reasoning and trims conjecture with a habitual caution he calls "the Rake." While traveling extramuros (outside the walls) with a small Peregrin (formal journey) company toward <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/blys-butte>Bly's Butte</a>, he examines evidence at Orolo's cell, infers that <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-orolo>Orolo</a> has gone north, and—after securing and destroying sensitive notes—quietly sends a trusted younger avout (cloistered scholar) to follow north, planning for the rest to continue toward Tredegarh.<h2>Appearance and Traits</h2><ul><li>Elderly, poised, and precise in language; often restates uncertainties explicitly.<li>Capable of a resonant, low register sometimes described as "subsonic."<li>Unflustered by unfamiliar praxes and tools, adopting them quickly when needed.<li>Inclined to historical framing and gently ironic turns of phrase; skeptical of over-interpretation.<li>Companions recall that, on the road north, he dropped a hint of being unnaturally old; when later pressed, he reframed longevity talk as a plausible "mythology" built from quantum‑level events and nearby "Narratives" in Hemn space, cautioning against promoting comforting stories to fact.</ul><h2>Roles and Actions</h2><ul><li>Peregrin leadership: Keeps discussions grounded during the detour toward Bly's Butte and helps reorganize seating and vehicles as plans change.<li>At Orolo's eyrie: Surveys a wall of leaves and phototypes, selects a few images of a large excavation for separate consideration, then orders Orolo's working leaves burned and confirms, on the spot, that Orolo has gone north.<li>Ecba/Orithena dig recognition: When presented with phototypes of a large, ordered excavation, he is described as recognizing the site at a glance as the buried remains associated with the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/temple-of-orithena>Temple of Orithena</a> on <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/ecba>Ecba</a>; he goes out of his way to ensure that Erasmas keeps those images for later work.<li>Gate invocation at Orithena: At the gate of the Temple of Orithena, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-erasmas>Erasmas</a> identifies him as "Fraa Jad, Millenarian" (thousand-year order) and states that Jad sent him to seek Orolo; this is part of the exchange preceding entry and highlights Jad's commissioning of the search.<li>Convox involvement and directive: Identified among those Evoked (formally summoned from the cloister) to the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/convox>Convox</a> (rare gathering of Evoked avout) at the Concent of Saunt Tredegarh; per Erasmas, Jad told him to "go north until you understand," implied a later return to Tredegarh, and is understood to have wanted Orolo fetched to the Convox.<li>Intercession at Tredegarh: By Erasmas’s account, Jad had promised on Bly’s Butte to "make it all okay" upon reaching Tredegarh; Erasmas later infers that this intervention succeeded at least enough for him to be permitted to celebrate Inbrase, though he suspects it may have earned Jad some enemies whose opposition now reaches him as well.<li>Reasoning about Orolo's work: In Orolo's later telling, Jad’s fast deductions from the wall leaves and a pruned "family tree" of the Hylaean Theoric World are explained as ordinary shared training; Orolo says Jad would infer Evenedrician datonomy (study of basic givens) and see Ecba as a place that would admit and sustain him.<li>Route inference over the pole: Companions later note that Jad had already reasoned out the practical way to reach the far side of the world without documents by traveling north to the sledge ports and going over the pole—an insight that reframes the search for Orolo.<li>On the visitor: Reviews a processed image of a vast icosahedral craft and its exterior geometric emblem; he adopts cautious labels (e.g., "the Cousins") while emphasizing the boundary between observation and speculation. In paraphrase, he also suggests that the craft's electrical systems might be susceptible to a burst from a field-inducing array, while others reply that the needed theorics are not commonly mastered.<li>Edhar's waste cavern: Describes a sealed cavern beneath Edhar that holds nuclear waste cylinders and explains the long-term maintenance of thatched covers as a thatcher's avocation passed down among the Thousanders.<li>Hospitality with monks: Accepts lodging at a mountain retreat of Bazian Orthodoxy, conversing in Orth and contributing a sustaining low drone at table prayer before dawn.<li>Support for the northbound search: His money card is later used by Erasmas to purchase fuel, food, and warm clothing for the drive into the mountains in pursuit of Orolo.<li>Hemn space framing and "Narratives": Within Tredegarh conversations, others explicitly attribute to Jad the use of "Narrative" to describe coherent worldtracks; the term is now in circulation among servitors and Sæcular advisors. Some worry about how to present such framing to hardheaded officials, and others joke that this line of talk challenges ordinary assumptions about time. These are reported as attributions and remarks by participants, not settled doctrine.<li>Messal contributions at Tredegarh: During a dinner dialog on Protism and questions about the plurality of worlds, he made a single, concise interjection that framed testability—observing that such claims could not be verified "unless those worlds came to us"—and later eased a fraught exchange by naming the subject a taboo and redirecting attention to historical experience, asking how the Matarrhites had fared in the Third Sack.<li>Quiet counsel at Tredegarh: In a veranda talk at Avrachon's Dowment, advises close attention to the cloaked Matarrhites, remarking that it would be impossible to pay too much attention to them; he distinguishes between how stories might play in the Sæculum and what matters within the Convox.<li>Conversation on praxis and aging: In the same exchange, frames claims of a life‑mending praxis as a "plausible and internally consistent mythology" rooted in quantum‑level events and nearby worldtracks in Hemn space; he notes that some at Tredegarh want to see such mythology promoted to fact for comfort but does not endorse doing so.</ul><h2>Relationships</h2><ul><li>With Fraa Erasmas: Treats the younger avout as a capable agent, privately directing him to go north in pursuit of Orolo and promising to help avert sanctions for lateness. Erasmas later reports using Jad's money card to outfit the journey and characterizes himself as "technically a Feral" for having let Jad "push" him into the detour. While recovering at sea, Erasmas reflects that Jad likely knew of the long-established migrant route over the pole and believes Jad did not intend to put him in mortal danger; he interprets any peril as misfortune or shifting conditions rather than design. When presented with a chance to travel a safer route instead, Erasmas explicitly invokes Jad's charge—calling him "the Millenarian who sent me"—and decides to continue the task rather than quit; this is presented as Erasmas's own reasoning and respect for Jad's sending. Upon reaching Tredegarh, Erasmas concludes that Jad kept his promise to "make it all okay," since he is allowed to celebrate Inbrase; he also suspects that Jad’s maneuvering has created opposition that now targets Erasmas.<li>With Fraa Orolo: Erasmas tells Orolo that Jad "could use your help" at the Convox and likely wanted Orolo’s thoughts on the Geometers (aliens in orbit) brought to that forum; Orolo demurs about trying to redirect such a large gathering and explains Jad’s quick deductions as arising from shared observation rather than secret communication. During the crisis at Orithena, Orolo further suggests that the most senior orders may already accept—and even test by their own methods—a view of mind and reality involving many parallel possibilities; he speculates that Jad sent Erasmas partly to gauge whether Orolo "knew." This is presented explicitly as Orolo's inference and is not independently confirmed. Later at Tredegarh, Jad remarks that Orolo would have passed through the Labyrinths in due time and become his fraa on the Crag; he speaks of looking forward to working by Orolo’s side.<li>With traveling companions: Others defer to him as a Thousander; he moderates speculation and settles practical matters with few words.<li>With extras: Speaks readily in Orth with extramuros allies and moves comfortably in their settings when it serves the work.</ul><h2>Current Status</h2><p>Associated with the Convox at the Concent of Saunt Tredegarh by report; not on the scene at Orithena. This account does not specify his precise whereabouts. Observers at Tredegarh describe him as apparently the only Millenarian present at the Convox.</div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>An elder Thousander of the Concent of Saunt Edhar, known for calm, exact speech and first‑principles reasoning.
