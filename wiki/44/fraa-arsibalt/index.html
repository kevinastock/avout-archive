During a Peregrin (sanctioned travel), he joins a small contingent detouring toward <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/blys-butte>Bly's Butte</a> to look for <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-orolo>Orolo</a> before continuing on. On the road he travels alongside a senior elder, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-jad>Fraa Jad</a>, and engages in extended exchanges about Sconic thought with the driver <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/ferman-beller>Ferman Beller</a> while accepting hospitality at a monastery associated with <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/bazian-church>Bazian Orthodox</a>.<h2>Appearance and Traits</h2><ul><li>Formal diction and careful distinctions; prefers to separate observation from conjecture.<li>Methodical and courteous; when uneasy he becomes extra polite. He is described as prone to motion sickness and sometimes shifts seats to steady himself.<li>Comfortable in Orth (mathic language) and Fluccish (vernacular) when needed, and eager to sketch arguments or calcas (didactic parables) to make abstract points clear.<li>In Erasmas's recollection during a hazardous moment, he imagines Arsibalt remarking "Just enough to read by!" about dim lightâ€”presented as Erasmas's remembered voice rather than a direct quote from the scene.<li>Recognizable to peers by emphatic, methodical knocking and distinct footfalls; shows open grief when speaking of Orolo.<li>Open about his belief in the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/hylaean-theoric-world>Hylaean Theoric World</a> when the context permits, while framing such belief with methodological caution and deference to senior avout.</ul><h2>Roles and Actions</h2><ul><li>Navigation and route finding: provides a profile sketch of distant peaks used with a cartabla (folding map) and historical clues to identify candidate mountains forming a triangle around the area of interest; helps set expectations about road conditions and timing; concurs with a plan to lodge nearby and start early.<li>Sconic explanations: outlines the "Sconic Discipline" as a third way between naive realism and radical skepticism, arguing that some topics (for example, a non spatiotemporal deity) are outside what pure thought can settle. He is expressly cited as explaining the "Fly, the Bat, and the Worm" parable to an extra (outsider) who asked about God; the framing emphasizes limits of method rather than a doctrinal claim.<li>Teaching by parable (calca): presents "The Fly, the Bat, and the Worm," in which differently sensing creatures converge on a shared language of geometry and time; extends the idea to how human minds integrate senses into a coherent model of the world.<li>Analytical caution: in a calca run with Hundreders (century vowed scholars), notes that a large icosahedral craft seems too small to carry the propulsion needed for interstellar speeds given its apparent mass, proposing as a hypothesis that the visitors or the craft might be from another cosmos. He ties this to interest in metatheoricians who address cross cosmos questions (the suggestion is framed as his speculation, not established fact).<li>Community tact: accepts books from the monastery on behalf of the group and gives a gracious acknowledgment.<li>Samble and Bly's Butte approach: present at Estemard's summit dwelling; on the patio outside Orolo's cell he signals to Erasmas that Estemard has become a Deolater (devotee of deity); joins the group for the town's picnic before departure.<li>Parting from the detour party: after the Samble picnic, Erasmas departs north and notes parting from Arsibalt and Lio; Arsibalt does not accompany that detour.<li>Lore source (recalled): Erasmas remembers hearingâ€”probably from Arsibaltâ€”that an order established a small math on Ecba to excavate the buried Temple of Orithena; at the time he had assumed it was only a few eccentrics with hand tools.<li>Message route to Ala (implied): Erasmas later regrets not entrusting Arsibalt (or Lio) with a note at the Samble picnic that could have been smuggled directly to Ala, suggesting Arsibalt had a means to reach her that bypassed ordinary post.<li>Position in debate (recalled): in a peer discussion about how minds evaluate possible futures (illustrated with a "pink dragon" hypothetical), Arsibalt is the one said to have objected to dismissing a richly modeled approach; this stance is attributed to his having been reading <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-paphlagon>Fraa Paphlagon</a> around the time that Paphlagon was Evoked (summoned out of the cloister).</ul><h2>Convox at Tredegarh</h2><ul><li>Presence and visit: already at the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/convox>Convox</a> (large convocation of avout), Arsibalt comes to see Fraa Erasmas while Erasmas is quarantined at the Concent of Saunt Tredegarh. They speak through reinforced window mesh; Arsibalt addresses him as "Fraa" and becomes tearful when they speak of Fraa Orolo.<li>Plenaries: Arsibalt describes "Plenary" (full assembly session) gatherings in a large nave where recordings ("speelies," playback recordings) are shown to brief everyone; he refers to an all-day Plenary after the Visitation at Orithena.<li>Analemma discussion: he asks about the Analemma (named temple symbol) that Orolo traced on the beach and recalls seeing a phototype of the Analemma in Orolo's cell; he notes that the remark about the Geometers having "deciphered" it remains unexplained.<li>Assignments: he notes that participants have been assigned to different Laboratoria (workrooms/labs) and have chosen different Lucubs (study groups).<li>Laboratorium work and preliminary findings: after Lucubs are suspended and effort shifted to focused Laboratoria, Arsibalt is placed on a spectroscopy and materials team tasked with attributing subassemblies of the visitors' icosahedral craft to their cosmi of origin. He later reports that their analysis suggests the ship is assembled from parts built across all four PAQD cosmi: with the oldest remnants from Pangee, very few pieces from Diasp, and most material from Antarct and Quatorâ€”of which Quator appears to have been visited more recently. These are presented as the team's working inferences.<li>Cloaked observers: following a remark from <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-jad>Fraa Jad</a> to pay attention to the "cloaked ones," Arsibalt privately suggests that these figures may not be Matarrhites at all; he does not elaborate on why, and the claim remains unverified. He wonders aloud whether they are meant to be observed more closely.<li>Companions: seen in Erasmas's company along with Barb during the day; later appears at Avrachon's Dowment as groups trade results and prepare for messal.</ul><h2>Relationships</h2><ul><li>Fraa Erasmas: peer, travel companion, and frequent collaborator during planning and on the road discussions. At Tredegarh he seeks Erasmas out during quarantine to offer sympathy and exchange information.<li>Fraa Jad: present elder whose remarks and presence shape the level of caution and inference Arsibalt adopts; he is specifically named as accompanying Erasmas, Arsibalt, and Lio to Bly's Butte.<li>Ferman Beller: primary interlocutor for Sconic discussions during the drive; Arsibalt uses parable and careful framing to bridge outlooks.<li>Sammann (Itaâ€”technical order): Arsibalt is described as unfailingly polite around him, signaling some discomfort even as the group cooperates.<li>Lio and other peers: participates in walking debates and calcas; shares concerns about practical risks while keeping an abstract lens handy.<li>Fraa Paphlagon: cited as a key reading influence for Arsibalt following Paphlagon's Evocation; that reading is mentioned as informing Arsibalt's side of later debate. At a Plurality of Worlds messal, Arsibalt serves as his servitor at table.<li>Ala (indirect): referenced when Erasmas considers that Arsibalt could have conveyed a private note to her via informal channels.</ul><h2>Current Status</h2><p>Arsibalt remains at the Concent of Saunt Tredegarh for the Convox. Following the reorganization toward focused Laboratoria, he is working on a spectroscopy/materials team studying the visitors' craft and has conveyed the team's preliminary inference that it incorporates subassemblies from multiple PAQD cosmi. He continues to cross paths with Erasmas and Barb and is seen at Avrachon's Dowment during messal preparations.<h2>Plurality of Worlds Messal</h2><ul><li>During a turn to Complex versus Simple Protism, Arsibalt took down a large rendering of the icosahedron to expose a slate wall and, with chalk, set out standard diagrams used by theorsâ€”the Freight Train, the Firing Squad, and the Wickâ€”for those at table and listening on the kitchen speaker; later he prepared to draw lightâ€‘bubble diagrams that track how givens propagate at light speed.<li>Serves as a kitchen-side servitor during a Plurality of Worlds messal hosted at Avrachon's Dowment, with Fraa Paphlagon as his doyn at table.<li>Helps keep the meal on track (after briefly incinerating a cutlet), adopts the local custom of signaling boredom by "voting with his feet," and labels an unlabeled summons rope for Emman Beldo.<li>During a side discussion about Hemn space, offers a plain-language example: a "block of ice in the middle of a star" would not be reachable by any plausible worldtrack.<li>Uses dry humor and steadying tact in the kitchen (e.g., joking about Allswell for a fussy diner; calming an over-eager colleague) while deferring to the host servitor on stove management.<li>Interprets a remark from Varax as a protective hint that the Inquisition would likely overturn an overly severe Book assignment from a doyn, advising Erasmas accordingly.<li>In a later kitchen exchange led by Grandsuur Moyra, he asks directly what precipitated the messal and then engages with questions about parallels across multiple worlds, acknowledging (with courteous reserve) his belief in the HTW and sketching how knowledge might propagate from a common theoric realm to different minds.<li>While continuing to shoulder pots and platters, he offers methodical, plain terms as the group considers whether there might be oneâ€‘toâ€‘one correspondences between their Saunts and those of other cosmi; others later cite his "iceâ€‘inâ€‘aâ€‘star" example as a useful way to talk about compossibility and worldtracks.</ul></div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>An avout Tenner of Saunt Edhar and peer of Fraa Erasmas.
