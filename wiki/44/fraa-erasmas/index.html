Guided by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-jad>Fraa Jad</a> and evidence preserved from Orolo’s cell, he identifies Orithena on Ecba as the target and ultimately reaches its gates; there he is admitted after recognizing it as a Lineage (pre-Cartasian order) cloister rather than a standard math (monastic order). Following the destruction at Orithena, he is transported by the Sæcular Power (worldly authorities) to Tredegarh to support the Convox (gathering) and is re‑inducted into mathic life there.<h2>Appearance and Traits</h2><p>Observant, reflective, and pragmatic, he often takes on planning and coordination while acknowledging limits in hands‑on mechanics. He learns quickly (including basic driving) and shows self‑awareness about how avout appear in Sæcular (outside world) spaces. He is frequently addressed as “Raz,” especially by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/cord>Cord</a>, and balances respect for Discipline (rules of mathic life) with situational flexibility. Recently he shows unease when conversations edge toward lore about Incanters, Thousanders’ secrets, or polycosmic praxis, recalling warnings received just before Orolo’s death.<h2>Roles and Actions</h2><ul><li>Refueling‑station analysis: Over food in a northern truck stop, reviews phototypes taken from Orolo’s cell; with a companion’s terminal, matches them to a live feed of a walled excavation on Ecba and notes features that tie it to Orithena. Treats this as a key to Orolo’s intentions.<li>Northbound decision: Accepts the inference that Orolo is likely headed over the pole and pivots the search accordingly toward a sledge port at extreme latitude.<li>Outfitting and logistics: Helps acquire suitsacks, winter tires, and deep‑cold coolants/lubricants; repacks loads and learns to drive during low‑traffic stretches. Mails a brief letter despite addressing hurdles.<li>New ally and city errands: Spends a day riding with Yulassetar Crade (a guide and cousin of a companion) to source gear cheaply; adopts practical advice for cold‑weather travel and vehicle maintenance.<li>Sledge‑port staging: Reaches the high‑latitude port, secures space for both vehicles on a flatbed, and stocks a rented housing module on the locomotive before the train departs across the ice.<li>Launch speely review: With <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/sammann>Sammann</a>, examines a short, low‑quality clip of eight white‑suited people boarding a coach before a large rocket launch; recognizes a tall rearmost walker by gait as Jesry.<li>Orithena gate and admission: At the gates of Orithena, exchanges words first in Fluccish (extramuros vernacular) and then in Orth (formal mathic language) with gatekeepers, including Suur Dymma and, later, Fraa Landasher. When challenged about the Vow (pledge not to leave) and references to the Discipline (rules of mathic life), the Anathem (ban) and Convox (gathering) are cited as constraints that make a return by Orolo and an unrelated Evocation incompatible with a normal math. Erasmas infers it is a Lineage cloister and is admitted.<li>Reunion with Orolo: Embraces Orolo at the cloister entrance, addressing him as “Pa.” Receives a bolt (avout robe) and chord (belt) to replace outside‑world clothes and spends time walking and talking with him in the orchards and meadows above the enclosure.<li>Dialogue with Orolo: Discusses Sconic (self‑observation school) themes and Evenedrician datonomy (study of givens), using concrete examples of how minds integrate perceptions, run counterfactuals, and prefer interpretations consistent with action‑like principles.<li>Convox mission and message: After being Evoked (formally summoned) to a Convox (gathering) at <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/convox-at-tredegarh>Convox at Tredegarh</a>, travels under the guidance of Fraa Jad to Bly’s Butte and then north. Later tells Orolo that Jad’s instruction—“go north until you understand”—implies bringing Orolo back to the Convox or at least informing it of Orolo’s line of inquiry.<li>Reports on the visitors: Relays outside observations that the visitors’ ship displays a geometric proof (Adrakhonic Theorem) and markings including letters and four planets—details Orolo had not seen at the time.<li>Tour of the dig: Guided by Suur Spry, descends into the excavation during the cool hours to see exposed pavements and foundations, then experiments with the tiles on the Decagon while playing The Teglon (tiling puzzle). Withdraws as heat rises and later takes advantage of a volcanic sluice‑bath to recover.<li>Life inside the cloister and hospitality for companions: Eats in the Refectory (dining hall) where the FAE (local lead) Fraa Landasher toasts his arrival. With Landasher’s consent, arranges for Cord, Yulassetar Crade, Ganelial Crade, and Sammann to lodge as guests in a separate house where outside‑world devices such as jeejahs (handheld devices) are permitted; he escorts them, explains basic mathic etiquette, and leads a tour of the dig.<li>Probe landing and evacuation: Witnesses the descent of a Geometers’ probe (visitors from orbit) into Orithena’s pit and follows Orolo to the plaza. Helps with reflective heat‑shields, measures the craft’s dimensions for Sammann’s record via jeejah (handheld device), and, at Orolo’s direction, organizes Orithenans to stretch the recovered parachute into a canopy to delay helicopters. When soldiers from the Sæcular Power (worldly authorities) enter the compound, Erasmas is collared and herded toward evacuation. He boards an aerocraft as a volcanic avalanche engulfs Orithena; from the air he sees Orolo fall with the destruction.<li>Post‑Orithena processing and transit: At a military beachhead later dubbed “New Orithena,” he assists a Tredegarh contingent in preparing the “givens” (evidence samples and remains) for shipment to the Convox (gathering), then departs for Tredegarh.<li>Quarantine and orientation at Tredegarh: Confined in a sealed housing module pending infection concerns, he receives visits from Arsibalt and Jesry. Jesry relays that laser analysis suggests “newmatter” (engineered nuclei), which in turn implies low cross‑infection risk; Erasmas expects release. Suur Maroa, a Centenarian Fifth Sconic (Sconic sect), interviews him about odors associated with recovered materials; he recalls a distinct unfamiliar smell, which she treats as a useful observation.<li>Inbrase and induction: Released to attend Inbrase (induction aut), he joins other Peregrins (traveling avout) for the formal end of Peregrination (traveling period). Asked to contribute a piece, he sings a solo computational chant derived from Orithenan practice; the performance draws noticeable attention from some Thousanders (long‑cycle avout) and prompts discussion among hierarchs. He exits enrolled among the Convox.<li>Messal customs: Briefed by Lio on Tredegarh’s messal (small hosted dinner) practice, in which servitors (junior attendants) serve under a doyn (senior host/mentor). He anticipates serving as a servitor and preparing for discussions at messals.<li>Plenary witness at Tredegarh: In the Unarian nave at Tredegarh, appears as an eyewitness at a Plenary conducted by <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-lodoghir>Fraa Lodoghir</a>, who serves as his loctor (interlocutor). Erasmas insists on his title and membership as an Edharian Fraa, accepts that he chose his peregrination to Orithena and its consequences, and gives a structured account of the Visitation as he saw it. He explains that his dialog with Orolo concerned consciousness and the Geometers, and he resists assigning blame without evidence when Lodoghir advances the notion that Orolo signaled the visitors using an analemma. The session closes abruptly as discussion rises in the hall.<li>Messal assignment and Sæcular contact: After the Plenary, Lodoghir claims Erasmas as his servitor within messal customs and declares himself doyn, directing them to take sustenance at a more remote messal. A Sæcular official, <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/emman-beldo>Emman Beldo</a>, speaks with Erasmas about priorities and indicates he will attend a subsequent messal hosted by “Madame Secretary,” Ignetha Foral.<li>Plurality of Worlds messal service: Serves as a servitor behind Lodoghir at a messal hosted at Avrachon’s Dowment, coordinating with Arsibalt, Suur Tris, and Suur Karvall in the kitchen. Uses the rope‑and‑bell signaling system, fields Lodoghir’s complaint about the soup, and chalks Emman Beldo’s name on an unlabeled pull. During the dinner, at Fraa Paphlagon’s prompting, gives a brief observation from Orithena about the probe’s parachute—judging it “nothing special,” not like engineered newmatter—and later gives Emman a plain‑language sketch of Hemn space and worldtracks as they are discussed at table. Plans to accompany Emman during Lucub to find a productive venue for evening work.<li>Inquisition attention: Notes an earlier encounter that day with Inquisitor Varax—interpreted, with Arsibalt’s help, as indicating oversight of possible Book‑chapter discipline and as a tacit warning to Lodoghir against overreach.<li>Edharian chapter‑house cosmography and observation watch: Later joins Fraa Jesry in an Edharian chalk hall reviewing pointing tables and timing for ground telescopes to observe the visitors’ icosahedral craft (the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/hedron>Hedron</a>). After a Sæcular aide privately discloses a plan to fly a silent reconnaissance “bird” onto an intercept course, Erasmas goes outside with companions to watch. At the expected moment they see a brief flash where the craft should be; the onlookers describe it as the ship firing a directed‑energy weapon—specifically an X‑ray laser—at the approaching satellite. The expectation is that the ship will rotate to bring its pusher plate between itself and the bogey, letting telescopes study newly exposed structure.<li>Walk with Lio and clandestine talk: On a late walk with Lio, hears that Lio was moved to a new laboratorium tasked with scraping and studying very old praxic documents dated just before the Terrible Events; those involved suspect they are original plans for the Everything Killers (doomsday‑class devices). Lio invites Erasmas into a network of Lucubs debating whether—and how—to contact the Antarcts independently using big‑telescope guidestar lasers; some participants believe the dead probe messenger’s blood matches that group, while projectiles in the body correspond to Pangee‑type matter. Lio adds that Ala initiated this clandestine Lucub network. Erasmas expresses shock and caution about the risks and legality of such moves.<li>Convox reorganization and ship‑modeling contribution: With Lucubs suspended and all but Laboratorium and Messal paused, joins a six‑theor team analyzing the visitors’ craft’s large‑scale dynamics. From its rapid attitude changes he infers counter‑rotating momentum‑wheel assemblies on three axes, and notes a brief “sloshing” consistent with a large standing‑water mass within the spun section. Emman is tasked with bringing the modeling system online; Jesry studies directed‑energy subsystems; Arsibalt uses spectroscopy to correlate subassemblies to the four PAQD cosmi; Barb examines an external strut lattice.<li>Open‑air assembly and Antiswarm kits: At an outdoor breakfast on the plaza before the Mynster, receives a pre‑packed rucksack and an inert badge as part of Antiswarm preparations. In conversation, Ala frames the Antiswarm as risk mitigation and likens it to a second Rebirth; she explains that badges will activate with rallying directions if dispersal is ordered. She further notes that some cell leaders have been dialoging in depth about independent contact strategies and states that Lodoghir is among that group.<li>Messal prep and counsel from Fraa Jad: While preparing food at Avrachon’s Dowment, meets Fraa Jad. He treats talk of a longevity praxis as a comforting mythology and advises that “it would be impossible to pay too much attention to the cloaked ones.” Shortly afterward, Erasmas compares notes with colleagues: Barb asserts a missing outer segment may have been detached to conceal a drive; Arsibalt reports mixed‑cosmi fabrication; Erasmas summarizes his team’s dynamics results.</ul><h2>Description</h2><ul><li>Common forms of address: “Fraa Erasmas” in formal settings; “Raz” among close friends and some extramuros allies.<li>Dress and condition on arrival at Tredegarh: Plain bolt and chord; visible scars and bruising from recent events.</ul><h2>Relationships</h2><ul><li>Fraa Orolo: Mentor and present objective; Erasmas commits to reaching Orithena to find him and reunites there. Their rapport shifts toward peers—Fraa and Fraa—while retaining affection and room for disagreement. Erasmas later witnesses Orolo’s last moments during the destruction at Orithena after the probe’s arrival.<li>Fraa Jad: Senior guide whose quiet direction and resources set the northbound pursuit in motion; Erasmas notes Jad is a Thousander (long‑cycle avout) and credits him with the directive to “go north until you understand,” which Erasmas interprets as license to return via Tredegarh with Orolo if possible. More recently, Jad discourages credence in a longevity praxis and directs attention to the cloaked visitors to the Convox.<li>Cord: Sib and close traveling companion; they coordinate driving and repairs. She reasons early that a sledge route over the pole is a likely way forward and later coordinates with Yulassetar Crade.<li>Sammann: Ita (technical order) partner in research and navigation; supplies lookups and route logs and helps analyze imagery that points toward Ecba and Orithena. Later accepts guest lodging within the cloister alongside the others.<li>Ganelial Crade and Yulassetar Crade: Extramuros allies; one organizes convoy movement while the other guides provisioning and travel in harsh conditions. Both accept guest accommodations when invited.<li>Suur Dymma and Fraa Landasher: Gate interlocutors at Orithena; Dymma questions his status and Landasher, identified as FAE (local lead), welcomes him. Landasher subsequently authorizes guest lodging for Erasmas’s companions.<li>Suur Spry: A resident who guides Erasmas through the excavation and serves as his companion during the tour.<li>Arsibalt: Friend and fellow Edharian; meets Erasmas at Tredegarh and shares grief for Orolo; they later work side‑by‑side as servitors during a messal at Avrachon’s Dowment. He continues to compare notes with Erasmas while the Convox analyzes the visitors’ craft.<li>Jesry: Long‑time friend who reports technical findings (including the “newmatter” point) and informs Erasmas that he has begun a liaison with Ala after their Voco (formal summoning). Erasmas chooses to wait for Ala’s decision.<li>Lio: Friend training under martial instructors at Tredegarh; briefs Erasmas on messal customs and uses “Raz” as a familiar nickname. Later confides restricted work on pre‑Terrible‑Events weapons plans and recruits Erasmas to a clandestine Lucub network debating independent contact with the Antarcts.<li>Tulia: Friend who physically extracts him from isolation so he won’t miss Inbrase; cautions him to be candid and avoid political maneuvering.<li>Suur Maroa: Centenarian of the Fifth Sconics who interviews Erasmas about odors linked to Geometer materials; treats his recollection as a useful observational datum.<li>Fraa Lodoghir: Senior Procian rhetor who serves as his loctor during a Plenary at Tredegarh; after the session, Lodoghir asserts the doyn–servitor relationship over Erasmas within messal custom. Erasmas later serves him at a high‑profile messal and navigates Lodoghir’s disciplinary posturing with care. Ala later identifies Lodoghir among the cell leaders engaged in deeper dialogs about independent contact.<li>Emman Beldo and Ignetha Foral: A Sæcular aide who coordinates with Erasmas before and during messal activities, and the senior doyn he answers to; Erasmas advises Beldo in plain terms and expects to join him for Lucub. Foral presides over discussions as “Madame Secretary,” probing how mathic debates connect to Sæcular priorities.<li>Ala: A young suur of Edhar with whom Erasmas shares close ties; he seeks contact and thinks of her during tense moments. By Lio’s report, Ala is working on contingency planning during the Convox and initiated the Lucub network exploring guidestar‑laser communication with the Antarcts. She later briefs Erasmas on Antiswarm plans and the logic behind dispersal.<li>Inquisition (Varax): A senior figure who pointedly remarks on Erasmas’s Book‑chapter standing, which Erasmas and Arsibalt take as a signal that extreme discipline from Lodoghir would be subject to review.</ul><h2>Current Status</h2><p>At Tredegarh, enrolled in the Convox following Inbrase (induction aut). Recently released from isolation, he has spoken as an eyewitness at a major Plenary and is now actively serving as a servitor to Fraa Lodoghir at messals, including a gathering hosted at Avrachon’s Dowment. He has also participated in an Edharian observation watch coordinated with Sæcular plans to prompt a change in the Hedron’s attitude, and has been invited into a clandestine Lucub network debating independent approaches to the visitors. Following a reorganization that paused all but Laboratorium and Messal, he works with a team of theors on a large‑scale dynamics model of the visitors’ craft. He has received an evacuation rucksack and an inert badge that will direct him to a preassigned cell if the Antiswarm is triggered.<h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>Name collision: Some accounts refer to a historical Thousander at Saunt Baritoe named Fraa Erasmas who, with Suur Uthentine, developed “Complex Protism.” That earlier figure is distinct from the present Decenarian of Edhar.</ul></div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>Fraa Erasmas is a Decenarian avout from the Concent of Saunt Edhar whose journey to Orithena on Ecba and the subsequent evacuation bring him to Tredegarh; there he is enrolled in the Convox, serves as a messal servitor, and contributes to modeling of the visitors’ craft and Antiswarm preparations.</div></div><div class=mb-3 data-pagefind-ignore><strong>First seen:</strong><br><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/1>Part 1: Provener - Chapter 1: Extramuros</a></div><div class=mb-3 data-pagefind-ignore><strong>Most recently seen:</strong><br><a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44>Part 10: Messal - Chapter 44: Rebirth</a></div><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Known as:</strong><br><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Fraa Erasmas</span><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Erasmas</span><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Fraa Raz</span><span class="badge bg-secondary me-1 mb-1" data-pagefind-weight=7>Raz</span></div><hr class=mb-3><div data-pagefind-ignore><a class=text-decoration-none href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/44/fraa-erasmas/history/> View history </a></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="container text-center"><hr><small>📚</small></footer><script src=https://avoutarchive.com/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=https://avoutarchive.com/dropdown-search.js></script>
