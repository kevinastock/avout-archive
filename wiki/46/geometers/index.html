The term carries no confirmed self-designation from the visitors and reflects human usage only. A newer usage in the same milieu is "PAQD" (Pangee‑Antarct‑Quator‑Diasp), sometimes shortened to "the pact" or "pact," favored by those who wish to emphasize a four‑way alliance across distinct matter types rather than an anthropomorphic label.<h2>Context and Usage</h2><ul><li>The names appear in discussions around the Convox and are used by avout (cloistered scholars) and Saeculars to reference the aliens without presuming motives or identity.<li>The aliens are linked to a massive icosahedral vessel commonly called the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/46/hedron>Hedron</a>, seen with a circular pusher plate oriented toward nearby craft. A leaked speely shows the Hedron keeping its pusher plate toward a human capsule, jamming communications, and manipulating the capsule via a robotic probe.<li>In a recorded encounter, a single representative—identified as the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/46/warden-of-heaven>Warden of Heaven</a>—was sent from the human capsule toward the Hedron at what appears to be the visitors' request to "send one." Communications from the capsule were jammed during the transfer. Hours later, the Hedron opened a central port on the base plate and ejected the Warden's body back toward the capsule. Whether the Warden died before or after ejection is not established in current accounts.</ul><h2>Direct Contact at Orithena</h2><ul><li>Descent and landing: Witnesses at Orithena describe a guided re-entry of a parachute‑retarded vehicle that transitioned to a rocket‑powered descent and landed on the Decagon plaza near the Analemma. The craft had a saucer‑like base, an upper cylindrical "bucket" with a domed top, deployable insect‑like legs, and several tall narrow hatches. No windows were seen. Observers repeatedly call it a "probe" and attribute it to the visitors.<li>Hatch markings and access: Around a trapezoidal hatch, onlookers report Geometer‑writing stenciled in paint, with arrow‑like lines pointing to small fastener‑held panels concealing T‑handles. The same stencil appeared in multiple places. When the handles were operated, a pressure‑equalizing hiss was heard before the door fell inward; participants inferred these were opening instructions.<li>Occupant: Inside sat a humanoid female‑appearing figure (close to Arbran morphology but recognizably different). She was warm to the touch when first reached but showed no pulse shortly thereafter. A physician on scene described many large circular puncture wounds across the back and concluded death had occurred within minutes. An experienced observer identified the pattern as consistent with a close/medium‑range shotgun‑type injury; this is presented as practical diagnosis, not lab confirmation.<li>On‑scene sensory notes: Early discussion at the site concluded the landing plume smelled of steam (hydrogen/oxygen propellants), with no toxic odor detected. Later, inside the probe, witnesses noted a distinct unfamiliar odor associated with the body; the smell was novel to those present.<li>Box of tubes: A fibrous case contained four clear tubes of red liquid, each labeled in Geometer script alongside a distinct circular planet ikon (not depicting Arbre). Onlookers inferred these to be blood or biological samples, but their purpose is not established.</ul><h2>Material Composition and Spectral Findings</h2><ul><li>Unusual laser wavelength: During a widely observed illumination event, a laser spot from the visitors was recorded onto a photomnemonic tablet (precision recording plate). Its measured wavelength does not match any naturally occurring spectral line known to avout.<li>Recovered materials: Earlier laboratory analyses of the Orithena probe’s hardware and remains described all sampled nuclei as engineered "<a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/46/newmatter>newmatter</a>." Recent tests now report that the four vials of fluid—assumed to be blood—are each made of nuclei incompatible with Arbre’s matter and also mutually incompatible with one another. Speakers are reframing the earlier "newmatter" reading as evidence of four distinct kinds of matter consistent with slightly different physical constants.<li>Provisional group labels: In discussion, the four kinds are informally nicknamed <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/46/antarcts>Antarcts</a>, "Pangees," "Diasps," and "Quators," based on planet iconography seen on the vessel and vials. These are human coinages, not confirmed self‑designations.<li>Ship subassemblies by matter type: A spectroscopy group at Tredegarh reports that the Hedron incorporates subassemblies originating from all four of the PAQD cosmi, with the oldest elements traced to Pangee, very few to Diasp, and the bulk from Antarct and Quator; of those two, Quator material appears to be more recent. This is presented as in‑world reporting, not as final confirmation.</ul><h2>Subsequent Strike and Interpretations</h2><ul><li>Kinetic event: Shortly after the landing, witnesses report a brilliant white object approaching from the west and striking the volcano above Orithena. Accounts describe it as a dense rod that penetrated the cap rock and vaporized, producing an earthquake, eruption, and a fast, incandescent ash‑cloud (pyroclastic flow) that destroyed structures at Orithena. Narrators attribute the strike to the visitors; this attribution is based on observation and in‑scene inference rather than direct claim by the visitors.<li>Possible internal conflict: Some speakers infer that factions among the visitors may be in conflict—one attempting to share information (e.g., by sending the probe) and another acting to prevent it, up to and including lethal force. A later claim holds that the deceased probe occupant's blood aligns with "Antarct" matter while embedded projectiles came from "Pangee," which participants cite as supporting this hypothesis; this remains an in‑story assertion rather than lab confirmation presented to readers.<li>Rhetorical indictment at Tredegarh: During a public dialog, a prominent Procian voice advanced a specific narrative that Saunt Orolo had signaled the visitors by means of an analemma, prompting their landfall at Orithena; he interpreted the subsequent kinetic strike as evidence of internal factional retaliation and cast Orolo’s later actions as an acceptance of responsibility. This was presented as argument, not as established fact, and drew mixed reactions in the nave.<li>Aftermath and information control: Military units from outside the walls arrived, collared and mustered witnesses, and secured the site. A live feed over the Reticulum (planetary network) was reportedly jammed locally by those forces; this concerns human response and does not clarify the visitors' intentions.</ul><h2>Related Observations and Inferences</h2><ul><li>Propulsion and posture: Observers note the Hedron's pusher plate and shuttered central port; some infer a nuclear‑pulse style propulsion. Detailed close‑ups show a heavy, egg‑like module mounted to a shock‑absorbing strut by oversized brackets and surrounded by a lattice of thrusters, spherical tanks, and antennae; some readers dub it a very large thermonuclear device that could be repositioned to an orbit opposite the mother ship. This remains analysis by Convox participants and does not establish the visitors' intent.<li>Attitude control and internal layout: Based on a recent forced reorientation, some teams now propose that the Hedron contains paired momentum‑wheel systems along three axes, allowing it to store and exchange angular momentum without firing thrusters.<li>Fluids indication: A subsequent analysis of the same maneuver notes small oscillations during spin‑up consistent with a large internal volume of standing water that "sloshes" when the ship is torqued suddenly.<li>Orbital countermeasure event: A silent reconnaissance satellite was deliberately maneuvered to pass near the Hedron so that, if the vessel reoriented to bring its pusher plate—presumed to serve as a shield—between itself and the approach, ground‑based telescopes could view structures normally hidden from Arbre. At the appointed time, witnesses on the ground saw a brief flash at the Hedron’s position and later stated the satellite had been "nailed" with a directed‑energy shot; one onlooker specified an X‑ray laser. The anticipated forced reorientation was not confirmed in those accounts.<li>High‑resolution imaging and authenticity: Subsequent ground‑based observations yielded phototypes that show additional structural detail, and the Adrakhonic diagram is plainly visible on the vessel. A Procian hypothesis that the image seen earlier had been forged into a phototype was publicly withdrawn.</ul><h2>Structural Changes and Missing Apparatus (claims)</h2><ul><li>A team studying a triangulated network of struts projecting from the despun section reports that the arrangement appears designed to mount a significant device and that the device itself is now absent. One commentator interprets the missing module as an inter‑cosmic transport drive relocated farther out in the system. This is characterization from in‑story voices; no direct confirmation is available.</ul><h2>Cognitive universals line of inquiry</h2><ul><li>One investigator frames the approach via the Sconic Discipline (epistemic discipline), arguing that any conscious mind must integrate sensory givens into spatiotemporal models and run counterfactuals; from this, he supposes the visitors would naturally converge on geometry and proof. This is presented as method and inference, not confirmed fact.</ul><h2>Plurality‑of‑worlds models</h2><ul><li>A set of speakers frame the differing matter as evidence that Arbre and the visitors’ origins trace separate trajectories ("worldtracks") in Hemn space that were once very close; this remains theorical framing to make sense of laboratory results.</ul><h2>Resource sourcing viewpoint</h2><ul><li>A Sæcular official argues the visitors can obtain water from comets and materials from asteroids and may not be capable of ordinary interstellar voyages; this is offered as a political framing for patience rather than as a tested claim.</ul><h2>Infiltration and first disclosures at Tredegarh</h2><ul><li>Revealed identity: During a protected session at Tredegarh, a doyn who had been passing as a Matarrhite removed his bolt and body transmitter once the room was shielded by a grounded mesh and identified himself as Jules Verne Durand of Laterre (the world known locally as "Antarct"). His minder—called Orhan—was from Urnud ("Pangee").<li>Seizure and insertion (his account): He stated that an Urnud/Tro team had seized a Matarrhite concent and used the opportunity to infiltrate the Convox in borrowed dress; the true Matarrhites were described as held, unharmed, but incommunicado.<li>Mission and fears (his account): He described himself as a junior linguist assigned to Orth and tasked by a military intelligence command to determine whether stories of Incanters (and Rhetors) had substance. According to him, the Urnud/Tro axis—calling itself the "Pedestal"—fears such powers and weighs a pre‑emptive strike.<li>Internal alignments (his account): He divided the PAQD into four origin worlds—Urnud (Pangee), Tro (Diasp), Laterre (Antarct), and Fthos (Quator)—with Urnud and Tro allied, Fthos opposed to them, and Laterre split in its loyalties.<li>Travel and provenance (his account): He summarized a history in which a ship called Daban Urnud, using a geometrodynamic route, crossed into other Narratives rather than backwards in time, yielding successive Advents that eventually brought the visitors here. This was offered as explanation, not as laboratory result.<li>Dietary incompatibility: He requested Laterran food, noting that Arbran enzymes could not act on his victuals (and conversely), consistent with earlier reports that their matter is incompatible with ours.<li>Weapons note (his reaction): He acknowledged the existence of destructive devices developed in Urnud’s wars and expressed horror at mention of a "World Burner." No claim was made as to current intent.</ul><h2>Related Terms</h2><ul><li>"Cousins" — an alternate human nickname for the same visitors.<li>"Hedron" — an in‑world nickname for the visitors' icosahedral craft (not their confirmed name for it).<li>"PAQD" / "the pact" — a naming convention highlighting the four inferred cosmi: Pangee, Antarct, Quator, Diasp.</ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>The visitors' motives, internal structure, and self‑designation are unknown. Current references derive from human observation and recordings; claims are presented here with attribution or hedging when based on in‑story inference rather than direct confirmation. Interpretations are evolving as new tests are reported.</ul></div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>An in-world term for the alien visitors now in orbit—also called "PAQD" (Pangee-Antarct-Quator-Diasp), "the pact," or "Cousins"—associated with a large icosahedral craft (the "Hedron").
