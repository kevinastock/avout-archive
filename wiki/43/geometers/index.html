The term carries no confirmed self-designation from the visitors and reflects human usage only.<h2>Context and Usage</h2><ul><li>The name appears in discussions around the Convox and is used by avout (cloistered scholars) and Saeculars (people outside maths) to reference the aliens without presuming motives or identity.<li>The aliens are linked to a massive icosahedral vessel commonly called the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/43/hedron>Hedron</a>, seen with a circular pusher plate oriented toward nearby craft. A leaked speely shows the Hedron keeping its pusher plate toward a human capsule, jamming communications, and manipulating the capsule via a robotic probe.<li>In a recorded encounter, a single representativeâ€”identified as the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/43/warden-of-heaven>Warden of Heaven</a>â€”was sent from the human capsule toward the Hedron at what appears to be the visitors' request to "send one." Communications from the capsule were jammed during the transfer. Hours later, the Hedron opened a central port on the base plate and ejected the Warden's body back toward the capsule. Whether the Warden died before or after ejection is not established in current accounts.</ul><h2>Direct Contact at Orithena</h2><ul><li>Descent and landing: Witnesses at Orithena describe a guided re-entry of a parachuteâ€‘retarded vehicle that transitioned to a rocketâ€‘powered descent and landed on the Decagon plaza near the Analemma. The craft had a saucerâ€‘like base, an upper cylindrical "bucket" with a domed top, deployable insectâ€‘like legs, and several tall narrow hatches. No windows were seen. Observers repeatedly call it a "probe" and attribute it to the Geometers.<li>Hatch markings and access: Around a trapezoidal hatch, onlookers report Geometerâ€‘writing stenciled in paint, with arrowâ€‘like lines pointing to small fastenerâ€‘held panels concealing Tâ€‘handles. The same stencil appeared in multiple places. When the handles were operated, a pressureâ€‘equalizing hiss was heard before the door fell inward; participants inferred these were opening instructions.<li>Occupant: Inside sat a humanoid femaleâ€‘appearing figure (close to Arbran morphology but recognizably different). She was warm to the touch when first reached but showed no pulse shortly thereafter. A physician on scene described many large circular puncture wounds across the back and concluded death had occurred within minutes. An experienced observer identified the pattern as consistent with a close/mediumâ€‘range shotgunâ€‘type injury; this is presented as practical diagnosis, not lab confirmation.<li>Onâ€‘scene sensory notes: Early discussion at the site concluded the landing plume smelled of steam (hydrogen/oxygen propellants), with no toxic odor detected. Later, inside the probe, witnesses noted a distinct unfamiliar odor associated with the body; the smell was novel to those present.<li>Box of tubes: A fibrous case contained four clear tubes of red liquid, each labeled in Geometer script alongside a distinct circular planet ikon (not depicting Arbre). Onlookers inferred these to be blood or biological samples, but their purpose is not established.</ul><h2>Material Composition and Spectral Findings</h2><ul><li>Unusual laser wavelength: During a widely observed illumination event, a laser spot from the visitors was recorded onto a photomnemonic tablet (precision recording plate). Its measured wavelength does not match any naturally occurring spectral line known to avout.<li>Recovered materials: Earlier laboratory analyses of the Orithena probeâ€™s hardware and remains described all sampled nuclei as engineered "<a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/43/newmatter>newmatter</a>." Recent tests now report that the four vials of fluidâ€”assumed to be bloodâ€”are each made of nuclei incompatible with Arbreâ€™s matter and also mutually incompatible with one another. Speakers are reframing the earlier "newmatter" reading as evidence of four distinct kinds of matter consistent with slightly different physical constants.<li>Provisional group labels: In discussion, the four kinds are informally nicknamed "Antarcts," "Pangees," "Diasps," and "Quators," based on planet iconography seen on the vessel and vials. These are human coinages, not confirmed selfâ€‘designations.<li>Interpretations: Some theors now infer that the visitors represent four groups originating from different cosmi or worldtracks that diverged very early in the cosmosâ€™s history; an alternative hypothesisâ€”that a propulsion device locally altered physical lawsâ€”has lost favor in light of the new findings. These remain inâ€‘story models, not established fact.<li>Biohazard implications (working view): If artifacts and tissues are composed of matter incompatible at the nuclear level, complex biochemistry is unlikely to cross over; simple chemical interactions can still occur, so caution remains warranted.<li>Capability inference: Observers note that the Orithena probe used an ordinary parachute; some take this as indirect evidence that the visitors themselves may not practice sophisticated matter engineering.</ul><h2>Subsequent Strike and Interpretations</h2><ul><li>Kinetic event: Shortly after the landing, witnesses report a brilliant white object approaching from the west and striking the volcano above Orithena. Accounts describe it as a dense rod that penetrated the cap rock and vaporized, producing an earthquake, eruption, and a fast, incandescent ashâ€‘cloud (pyroclastic flow) that destroyed structures at Orithena. Narrators attribute the strike to the Geometers; this attribution is based on observation and inâ€‘scene inference rather than direct claim by the visitors.<li>Possible internal conflict: Some speakers infer that factions among the visitors may be in conflictâ€”one attempting to share information (e.g., by sending the probe) and another acting to prevent it, up to and including lethal force. A later claim holds that the deceased probe occupant's blood aligns with "Antarct" matter while embedded projectiles came from "Pangee," which participants cite as supporting this hypothesis; this remains an inâ€‘story assertion rather than lab confirmation presented to readers.<li>Rhetorical indictment at Tredegarh: During a public dialog, a prominent Procian voice advanced a specific narrative that Saunt Orolo had signaled the visitors by means of an analemma, prompting their landfall at Orithena; he interpreted the subsequent kinetic strike as evidence of internal factional retaliation and cast Oroloâ€™s later actions as an acceptance of responsibility. This was presented as argument, not as established fact, and drew mixed reactions in the nave.<li>Aftermath and information control: Military units from outside the walls arrived, collared and mustered witnesses, and secured the site. A live feed over the Reticulum (planetary network) was reportedly jammed locally by those forces; this concerns human response and does not clarify the visitors' intentions.</ul><h2>Related Observations and Inferences</h2><ul><li>Propulsion and posture: Observers note the Hedron's pusher plate and shuttered central port; some infer a nuclearâ€‘pulse style propulsion. During a prior encounter, the visitors' probe appeared to recognize and use a lifting bracket on a human suit, suggesting technical understanding of human equipment.<li>Orbital countermeasure event: A silent reconnaissance satellite was deliberately maneuvered to pass near the Hedron so that, if the vessel reoriented to bring its pusher plateâ€”presumed to serve as a shieldâ€”between itself and the approach, groundâ€‘based telescopes could view structures normally hidden from Arbre. At the appointed time, witnesses on the ground saw a brief flash at the Hedronâ€™s position and later stated the satellite had been "nailed" with a directedâ€‘energy shot; one onlooker specified an Xâ€‘ray laser. The anticipated forced reorientation was not confirmed in those accounts.<li>Highâ€‘resolution imaging and authenticity: Subsequent groundâ€‘based observations yielded phototypes that show additional structural detail, and the Adrakhonic diagram is plainly visible on the vessel. A Procian hypothesis that the image seen earlier had been forged into a phototype was publicly withdrawn.<li>Detachable device nicknamed "World Burner": Detailed closeâ€‘ups highlight a squat grey eggâ€‘like module mounted directly to a shockâ€‘absorbing strut by oversized brackets and surrounded by a lattice of thrusters, spherical tanks, and antennae. Calculations on bracket crossâ€‘sections imply extraordinary mass. Interpreters conclude the core is an ultraâ€‘heavy, fissionable metal and read the assembly as a very large thermonuclear device, with propellant sufficient to reposition it to an orbit opposite the mother ship. If detonated there, it could irradiate and ignite the hemisphere facing it. This remains analysis by Convox participants and does not establish the visitors' intent.<li>Strategic posture: The vessel's orbit and earlier planeâ€‘change maneuvers lead some participants to suggest that the visitors must manage limited "fuel" for propulsion. Members of the traveling party interpret a prior night of laser illumination as signaling interest in sites believed to hold nuclear material, naming major concents such as the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/43/concent-of-saunt-tredegarh>Concent of Saunt Tredegarh</a>. These are interpretations voiced inâ€‘story and are not verified facts.<li>Mathematical signage and proof culture: Avout who have seen images describe a diagram on the Hedron that is widely interpreted as a proof of the <a href=https://avoutarchive.com/wiki/43/adrakhonic-theorem>Adrakhonic Theorem</a> (a classical geometric result), along with letterâ€‘like symbols and four planet glyphs. Speakers infer this as deliberate use of universal mathematics to initiate contact and as evidence that the visitors value Truth and Proof; the specific reading remains interpretive, and not all witnesses have viewed the images firsthand.<li>Cognitive universals line of inquiry: One investigator frames the approach via the Sconic Discipline (epistemic discipline), arguing that any conscious mind must integrate sensory givens into spatiotemporal models and run counterfactuals; from this, he supposes the visitors would naturally converge on geometry and proof. This is presented as method and inference, not confirmed fact.<li>Pluralityâ€‘ofâ€‘worlds models: A set of speakers frame the differing matter as evidence that Arbre and the visitorsâ€™ origins trace separate trajectories ("worldtracks") in Hemn space that were once very close; this remains theorical framing to make sense of laboratory results.<li>Resource sourcing viewpoint: A SÃ¦cular official argues the visitors can obtain water from comets and materials from asteroids and may not be capable of ordinary interstellar voyages; this is offered as a political framing for patience rather than as a tested claim.</ul><h2>Related Terms</h2><ul><li>"Cousins" â€” an alternate human nickname for the same visitors.<li>"Hedron" â€” an inâ€‘world nickname for the visitors' icosahedral craft (not their confirmed name for it).</ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>The Geometers' motives, internal structure, and selfâ€‘designation are unknown. Current references derive from human observation and recordings; claims are presented here with attribution or hedging when based on inâ€‘story inference rather than direct confirmation. Interpretations are evolving as new tests are reported.</ul></div><div class=col-md-4><div class=card><div class=card-body><div class=mb-3><strong data-pagefind-ignore>Summary:</strong><div class=text-muted><p class=mb-0>An in-world term for the alien visitors now in orbit (also called 'Cousins'), associated with a large icosahedral craft (the 'Hedron').
